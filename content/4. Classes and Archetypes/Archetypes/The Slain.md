The Slain are Heralds that have embraced their inevitable death, emulating their Vanir hero, Thonir, and intending to serve him in their afterlife. They enforce clan law and often serve as executioners, ridding the raiders of criminals and the corrupt. The Slain believe the laws they follow are above those of the living. Those that take the Oath of the Slain often paint their faces white and their tattoos often resemble death wounds. Primarily loners, the order meets rarely, usually only during the Gathering at Drifthall every eight years, where they exchange knowledge and take on apprentices.
However, though unusual, it is not unheard of for a few members of the order to temporarily band together to take on a larger threat.

### Tenets of the Slain
- **Glory.** You desire to prove your worth to the gods and undertake dangerous endeavors to gain glory to honor them and ensure you are worthy of standing at their side in the afterlife.
- **Incorruptible.** The laws of Grimnir are above all other things, including friends and relationships. You know what is right or wrong and it is your duty to enforce a law in a righteous but fair manner.
- **Death is the Beginning.** Dying only transforms you into a greater being to serve the will of the gods.
- **Prepare for the End.** Wealth is meant to be spent to better Grimnir and its peoples, and for preparing them against the inevitable end of the world.

Add the necrotic school of magic to your list of herald spells.

### Channel Divinity
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:
#### Fight to the Last. 
Immediately after you damage an opponent you may use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to heal creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you. You may distribute hit points equal to twice your level in this class among the creatures you’ve chosen. If a creature was at zero hit points when you use this feature on them, this healing effect is doubled for them.
#### Mark of the Executioner. 
As a bonus action you can use your Channel Divinity to mark an enemy for execution. For the next minute, whenever you attack this marked creature, you score a critical hit on an 18 or higher.

### Aura of the Executioner
Starting at 7th level, you always emanate an aura that grants you and your allies increased focus when attacking enemies. You, and any allies within 10 feet of you, may add 1d4 to all attack rolls made each turn. This benefit ends if you become incapacitated.<br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 20 feet and the attack roll bonus increases to 1d6.

### A Glorious Sacrifice
Starting at 15th level, your dedication prevents you from dying easily and if you die, no spell, magical effect, or other feature can ever make you return to life as an undead creature.<br>
Additionally, after taking damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and does not kill you outright, you may use your reaction to temporarily thwart death and remain conscious. You immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn, but can only take the Attack action as well as any movement required to reach an enemy to attack. The movement provided by this feature does not provoke opportunity attacks.
You are considered to have failed one death saving throw by activating this feature and while you have 0 hit points, damage against you causes you to fail another death saving throw (three death saving throw failures will kill you). When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Justice Delivered
Starting at 20th level, you are grimly determined to have a death worthy of the greatest of heroes. You may use an action to undergo a transformation that lasts for 1 minute (or until you are incapacitated or killed). During this time you have the following benefits:
- **Impervious Flesh.** You gain resistance to all damage.
- **Of One Mind.** You are immune to being charmed and any allies within 30 feet have advantage on saving throws against charm effects.
- **Might of the Gods.** When an ally within 10 feet hits an enemy with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to attack that enemy (if you are in range) with advantage.<br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
