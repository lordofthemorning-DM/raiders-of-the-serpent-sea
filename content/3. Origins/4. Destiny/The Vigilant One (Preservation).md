You are the last of a powerful family that, for generations, has kept watch on the ancient woods, the great mountains, and the howling sands of the southern deserts.

Were the Yoten to return, your destiny is to stand firm against them. Yet you are now alone, except for the ravens that fly across the Serpent Sea and whisper to you all that they see, all that they hear. The time is coming, the ravens say. The time for watching ends... the time for war begins.

Yet you are troubled. All your life you have suffered severe nightmares, catching glimpses of horrid creatures you presume are the Yoten. In all of these nightmares you fight against them… and you fall, you fail.
- **Player Interest**: Jeor Mormont, Heimdall, Obi-Wan Kenobi   
- **Restrictions:** Must be born in Grimnir

#### Source of Inspiration
You understand the importance of protecting the knowledge of those who came before you, their traditions and their creations. You gain inspiration whenever you help recover or preserve something ancient. You also gain inspiration anytime you complete a Heroic Task.<br>
_Recover a scroll of lost knowledge, practice an endangered language, protect an important historic or religious site, preserve an ancient relic, learn a custom or technique of an old society._

#### Inspiration Feature
Your experience with maintaining ancient traditions and customs can help you remember the strangest bits of knowledge. Whenever you or an ally you can see fails an Arcana, Culture, History, Nature, or Religion roll, you can use a reaction to learn any information that would have been gained from a successful check.

#### Feature: The Rune of the Vigilant ( ᚲ )

You were born with a birthmark where most raiders receive their clan tattoo. The symbol is ᚲ and it differentiated you, marked you—you inherited your parent’s obligation to watch for the return of the Yoten. The rune inspired the seeking of the knowledge you needed to take your fated post, as well as the sacrifices you have already made—and the ones you know you must make in the future.

At certain moments in the story additional runes will be drawn, adding to your story, your abilities, and your penultimate reason for existing.

#### Feature: Afflicted

Your nightmares are more than just disturbing… they can cause restless sleeps. After each long rest roll a d20. If the result is 1 or 2 you suffer 5 (2d4) psychic damage, ignoring any resistances or immunities. If you roll maximum damage, you are also afflicted with a short-term mental stress effect. This damage cannot reduce you to less than one hit point.

#### Feature: Aware

With the help of the ravens, you see things that others do not. Once per long rest you may activate this feature and it lasts for an hour. During this time, you have a +5 bonus to any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks and you have advantage on these checks. If successful and you are outdoors (or in a building with windows) a white raven appears to help point out a feature to you. In indoor areas, or underground, a small white feather might be found floating near the clue. You also have advantage on initiative, and it is impossible to surprise you.

|#### Perception Checks <br><br>The bonus applies to your passive Perception checks as well, meaning that you have a total of +10 to your passive Perception checks while this feature is active.|

### Suggested Characteristics

Your family has long been respected and their lineage extends into many of the most prominent raiding families, across most clans. Yet you alone were marked at birth to take on the mantle. Knowing the sacrifice you must make throughout life—and the one you might make at the very end—you have lived a life different from most raiders.

### Suggested Story Connection  

Weeks ago, you left your cabin in the woods, wrapped your fur cloak tightly around your shoulders and walked to the nearest raider town. Upon your return messages were sent and Hrolf’s expedition diverted to pick you up. The ravens were clear—you must accompany Hrolf to the tower at Kekkell.
