## Ships of the Sea

With the raiders spread across several small continents and numerous islands, the Serpent Sea is an essential lifeline: the waters provide food, trading opportunities, and the chance to capture enemy ships and treasure. Raiders take great pride in the longships they build to navigate those treacherous waters. Additionally—and just as importantly—longships can sail into the smaller rivers penetrating all the major land masses. This gives the raiders the ability to strike anywhere, even deep into enemy lands.

## Ship Types

There are a handful of standard ship designs, but each vessel is unique—these are merely guidelines. A few coastal villages offer ship construction and customization services and are indicated in the Serpent Sea Campaign Book.

|#### Portage<br><br>The ship descriptions indicate whether a vesseel can be portaged (carried or rolled overland to avoid obstacles or to move between different bodies of water). At least half of the indicated crew is required to portage a vessel.|

### Longship Types

Some longships are made for swiftness and scouting, others for raiding. They have oars for rowing as well as sails to increase speed when at sea. Specific makes also have varying crew requirements and cargo capacity. 

#### Longship: Carver

This is the largest standard longship. Few carvers exist, given their expense to create and maintain, but those that do sail the Serpent Sea are fearsome, powerful vessels. Their length and width also accommodate the shipment of goods and the crew complement makes for a very well defended longship.

#### Longship: Charger

Chargers are larger than explorers, host a crew of around thirty, and boast additional cargo and passenger space. These are the standard longships used by established clans when raiding and they form the bulk of war fleets. Most young raiders grow up dreaming of owning such a vessel.

#### Longship: Explorer

This is the smallest of the longships (usually no more than 50 feet long) and requires a crew of fourteen to row at full speed. Like all longships there is no lower deck or cabins so a crew must have the conviction (and patience) to sail long distances with one another on the open deck. Given its lighter crew and faster speeds, it is often used as a scouting vessel.

### Faering

This is a four-oar rowing ship with a small sail. Though much smaller than a longship it can move a small party down most rivers and along the Serpent Sea itself, if they keep the coastline visible.

### Mercanskip

Mercanskip is the raider name for the plump merchant vessels that the Baendur use to trade between their disparate kingdoms. Slow moving but heavily armored they are usually accompanied by numerous longships for protection. A few clans have kept mercanskips that they have plundered, making the ship an uncommon but not impossible sight amongst a raiding fleet as well. 

### Hjemskip 

These large vessels are affectionately termed houseboats. Larger and spacious, they are also slow moving, and are never part of normal fleet operations. Most clans have one or two of these wooden vessels, usually docked at their primary village and set upon the Serpent Sea only to attend the Gathering at Drifthall every eight years.

## Sailing the Serpent Sea

### Cargo

Smaller ships carry only the possessions each person brings aboard with room for the loot they hope to acquire. Hauling extra food, mead, or other provisions requires a larger ship. Only carvers, mercanskips, and hjemskips can transport horses and other heavy cargo.

### Constructing Temporary Defenses

However, the crew can ensure there’s a safe haven for the heroes to return to (or retreat to, depending on the situation). Assuming there’s wood available, a charger or larger longship crew can complete a basic camp in twelve hours—double the time for a smaller crew. The camp consists of several simple tents and a semi-circle wall formed from cheval-de-frise along the perimeter, protecting the tents and the beached longships.

Crew with higher morale and better-quality tools and material can build faster and more elaborate temporary camps. More details on these defenses—and ways to upgrade them—are found in the Serpent Sea Campaign Book.

| #### Cheval-de-frise<br><br>These spiked walls prevent charges into a camp and can slow an attacker, if not stop them outright. Assuming wooden cheval-de-frise, each 10-foot section has AC 15 and 27 hit points and immunity to poison and psychic damage as well as immunity to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, unconscious.<br><br>Attempting to climb over these defenses requires 10 feet of movement and counts as difficult terrain (and likely exposes the climber to attacks). If the climber takes any damage, they must succeed at a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall, suffering 5 (2d4) piercing damage.<br><br>Attempting to charge through a section of cheval-de-frise inflicts 15 (6d4) piercing damage to the object hitting the wall. |

### The Crew

A crew is necessary to row or sail a longship. Heroes need to treat these crews well or else they might end up stranded on a desolate island in the middle of the Serpent Sea. It takes some effort (and generosity) to ensure that a crew works well together.
#### The Crew are not Expendable
Morale plummets if the heroes keep bringing the crew into dangerous dungeons and forbidden forests (and costing them their lives). If the crew is dragged into these adventure areas it diminishes the glory the heroes receive, it endangers the crew, and it makes it much harder to be stealthy. Any group larger than ten will generally force all Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks to be made with disadvantage. And… overcoming a much smaller force with a larger force generally rewards no glory.
#### Paying the Crew
One of the most important aspects is in how the party pays the crew. Some crew request an initial payment up front and then a share of plunder. An optional simplification is to have the game master take 20 percent of all treasure the heroes obtain which disappears into the hands of the crew. Less than 20 percent might result in an unhappier crew, a higher percentage increases happiness (there are rules in the Serpent Sea Campaign Book regarding crew morale and specialized NPCs who take a larger share of treasure).

Heroes may further endear themselves to their crew if they treat them to food and drink whenever they visit a feast hall!
