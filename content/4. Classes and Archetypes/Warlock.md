House Rules

Pact of the Blade is altered as follows. You can no longer apply your magic or rare weapon bonuses of your pact weapon to your eldritch blast. You may spend one spell point as part of the attack action to convert the any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage of your pact weapon into force damage. Lastly, Pact of the Blade automatically allows you to attack twice using your pact weapon at level 5 and this counts as extra attack for the purpose of combat maneuvers.

Given you now automatically get extra attack, the Thirsting Blade invocation is altered as follows.
### Thirsting Blade
Choose one of the following combat maneuver traditions: [[Arcane Knight]], [[Eldritch Blackguard]], [[Cutting Omen]], [[Sanctified Steel]], or Tempered Iron. You do not gain exertion, and you may never use maneuvers learned through this feature by spending exertion. Instead, you use these maneuvers by expending spell points equal to the required exertion. You may not spend spell points to use maneuvers learned in another way. You learn two maneuvers from the listed tradition, and another at levels 5, 9, 13, and 17, retroactive if you take the invocation at a higher level, and use the Herald table to determine the maximum maneuver degree you can learn. Maximum maneuver degree stacks with multiclassing as normal, but maneuvers known are only gained based off of warlock level. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you may choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another of the same level or lower from a tradition you are proficient with.

The following additional Eldritch Invocations are allowed:
### A BLADE, YET NOT A BLADE 
*Prerequisites: Pact of the Blade, 7th level* <br>
You may use your pact weapon as a spellcasting focus for warlock spells, and the following eldritch invocations can be used on attacks with your pact weapon in addition to Eldritch Blast: Eldritch Grasp, Eldritch Elementalism (applying only to the bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage of the weapon itself, not bonus damage of other types form magic weapons or class abilities), Eldritch Tentacle, and Repelling Blast. 
### MANUAL OF DESTRUCTIVE SECRETS 
*Prerequisites: Pact of the Tome, 9th level* <br>
You decode magic sigils of power in your Book of Shadows. You may add one spell each of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level from any class list to your tome. These count as warlock spells for you, do not count against your maximum number of spells known, and you may cast each of these spells once per long rest without expending spell points. 
### SPIRIT BINDER 
*Prerequisites: 5th level* <br>
You learn the spirit guardians spell, and the spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

The following additional Secrets of Arcana are allowed:
### GUIDING WILL 
*Prerequisites: 11th level* <br>
You have an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost. You may also cast the find the path spell at will without expending spell points. When doing so it does not require concentration and lasts until you visit the chosen location or until you cast it again rather than 24 hours. In addition, you may choose a specific immovable location you have not been to before. Once you have used this option, you may not do so again until you have visited the chosen location. 
### INVERTED GAIT 
*Prerequisites: 7th level* <br>
You are under the permanent effect of the spider climb spell. 
### THOUGHTSENSE 
*Prerequisites: 11th level* <br>
You are subtly aware of the presence of nearby thinking creatures. You can use an action to scan for thinking creatures within 30 ft that you canâ€™t see. This can only detect creatures with an Intelligence of 4 or higher and that speak or understand at least one language. If you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you gain an expertise die on Perception checks made to locate them. The ability penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead. You also have an expertise die on perception checks made to avoid being surprised by qualifying creatures. 
### TOME OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 
*Prerequisites: Pact of the Tome* <br>
Your Book Of Shadows serves as a masterwork book on a plethora of eldritch secrets. By spending 1 hour reading your Book of Shadows (which may be part of a short or long rest), you may select a number of specialties in Arcana, History, and/or Religion equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) and gain an expertise die on checks made regarding the chosen specialties. Each time you study the book in this manner, you may replace any or all of these selections with new ones. In addition, while you have access to your Book of Shadows you may perform the research downtime activity without needing access to a library. 
### UNNATURAL WARNING 
You gain an expertise die on saving throws against traps. In addition, you may cast the find traps spell without expending spell points once per short or long rest.


Unlike standard 5e, A5e warlocks choose their bonus patron spell lists independent of their actual patron; two warlocks of the same archetype might have different patron spell lists.  The ones included in the base class (see link above) are a good start, but they could definitely stand to have some additional options, a fact 3rd party publishers (including myself) have definitely taken notice of, and as such the following lists are also allowed.  

Additional Patron Spell lists:



| Water               |                                             |

Finally, if you choose the Psionics spell list from the base class, replace *enthrall* with *calm emotions*, and if choosing the Darkness list replace *blight* with *confusion*.  *Blight* and *enthrall* are both already on the warlock spell list, which limits their usefulness on a feature whose primary purpose is to add additional spells you can choose as if they were on your class list.
