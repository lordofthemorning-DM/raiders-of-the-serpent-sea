### Weapons
All simple and martial weapons from A5e are allowed except the shortsword, handaxe, and rapier.  The former two are replaced by campaign specific variants of the Sax and Skeggøx (see below, properties include those from the iron material already listed).
#### Sax
This short sword has a slashing edge and though these weapons are simply constructed, they are versatile and used by many raiders as their secondary weapon.

#### Skeggøx
This versatile handaxe has a wide cutting surface suitable for use in battle, but the haft can be gripped directly behind the head to work with wood. Additionally, the weapon can be turned over to strike enemies with the hammer end

### Armor
Raiders generally do not make half-plate or full plate armor.  Iron is ill-suited to the task, and as such the only such armor available is made of steel and confiscated from the Baendur.  Likewise, tower shields are not made by Raiders and are only found among the Baendur or having been taken from them, regardless of material.

### Materials
Raiders lack the metallurgical skill and ore deposits necessary to make proper steel.  Thus, all metal weapons and armor used by raiders are made of iron by default.  Because this is the standard, rather than costing half as much as steel, iron equipment instead costs the standard amount with steel costing twice as much (as the only steel available is that which is captured in battle or from raided settlements; this is, indeed, a major motivation behind undertaking raids)  The sax and Skeggøx are raider specific weapons and are never found made of steel.<br>
The other properties of iron equipment can be found under the material rules, but have been reproduced here for your convenience. Iron equipment weighs 50% as much as normal, if it has a minimum strength requirement that requirement increases by 1 (the Weighty property), and anytime it is exposed directly to water you must make a maintenance check and cannot repair an item that becomes broken or damaged as a result (the Rust property).

The Adamantine and Mithral materials do not exist in Grimnir, and as such armor made of them (such as an elven breastplate, which is just a breastplate made of mithral) also do not exist and are not available.

There is one new special material unique to Grimnir: Ironwood 
#### Ironwood
Among the most prized weapons and armor are those crafted from a lightweight but unnaturally strong material known as ironwood. The name is a misnomer for ironwood is harvested from the leaves of the mysterious ironheart trees that grow in the deep woods of the inner continent (but have been increasingly found far from their normal habitat). The leaves are worked much like iron (though after being forged they become immune to fire and reforging) and most weapons and armor have an ironwood variant. Though prized for their durability, some raiders avoid the use of these items, fearing that they are corrupted because the ironheart trees are associated with the dread Witchking and his ironwood witches. Ironwood weapons are generally not able to be purchased; they must be found or made, with only the most skilled of craftspeople knowing how.<br>
Ironwood effectively functions as mithral, with the following changes: weapons made of ironwood count as magical for the purpose of damage resistance and immunity, ironwood armor grants an expertise die on saving throws against effects that deal fire damage (ironwood as a material is immune to fire after being shaped), and ironwood equipment cannot be repaired if it becomes damaged or broken.
