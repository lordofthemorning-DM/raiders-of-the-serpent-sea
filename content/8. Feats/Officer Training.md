You have been taught to lead people in battle and the basics of strategy and tactics. You gain the following benefits: 
- You have learned to keep your head in battle. If you fail a save against an effect that would cause you to become charmed, confused, or frightened, you can roll a d4 and add it to the result. Once you have used this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest. 
- You gain two Lessons of War from the marshal class. You must meet any prerequisites a given lesson has to select it.
