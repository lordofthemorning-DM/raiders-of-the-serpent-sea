All raiders seek glory in battle and the spoils that come from a life full of successful raids. Yet only a few live long enough to achieve these aims. A marauder demonstrates leadership via small skirmishes at first and slowly they build upon their reputation. As their glory rises, so do their opportunities. The marauder understands how to control any battlefield they find themselves upon, from the deck of a ship being tossed by a foul storm to the wind-tossed tundra of the north. They minimize their own losses while inflicting great damage upon their enemies. A true leader leads by ferocious stubbornness and the marauder is no exception.

### Control the Battlefield
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you may attempt to shove a creature as a bonus action, and if the creature you are trying to shove is already prone, you automatically succeed on your check to shove them. In addition, when you shove a creature and choose to push them, you can push them up to 10 feet away instead of 5 feet.

### Withdraw
Starting at 3rd level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you may use a reaction to move 10 feet away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. The attacker may then use their reaction to move 10 feet directly towards you. Their movement can provoke opportunity attacks as it normally would.

### Clear the Decks
Starting at 7th level, you may use an action to strike the ground. All creatures within 5 feet must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. A creature that fails the saving throw is pushed 10 feet from you and knocked prone.

### Rampage
Starting at 11th level, whenever an allied creature within 10 feet of you (this includes you) reduces a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, they may take a bonus action to move up to half their speed and make another attack.

### Enhanced Rampage
Starting at 15th level, your Rampage featureâ€™s effective range widens to equal your Commanding Presence aura. Additionally, any affected allies may add a 1d6 expertise die to any attack rolls they make as part of your Rampage ability.

### End the Threat
Starting at 18th level, you use a bonus action to shout a command to your companions to attack a specific target. Any allies within 30 feet of you that hear you may use their reaction to move half of their movement and make a weapon attack or cast a cantrip against the target you specified.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.
