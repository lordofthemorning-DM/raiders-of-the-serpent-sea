### Stalker 
***Prerequisites:** 3 levels in ranger, 3 levels in rogue* <br>
You have combined the methods and tricks of two of the most elusive skill sets in the world. Attempting to locate you when you do not wish to be found is a frustrating endeavor. You gain the following benefits: 
- Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- If you are not proficient with the Stealth skill, you become proficient now, and you gain an expertise die in Stealth. Your expertise die in Stealth can be upgraded from a d8 to a d10 in this way. 
- You acquire the Stealth skill specialty of your choice. 
- You can use your Sneak Attack feature with any one-handed melee weapon, not only ones with the finesse property. 
- If you have been in a city for at least a week continuously, you gain the benefits of your Favored Terrain feature while within its limits. 

### Whisper Foot 
***Prerequisite:** Stalker feat* <br>
You become even harder to find, able to slip unseen into even well-guarded locations. You gain the following benefits: 
- You gain an expertise die to Stealth. Your expertise die in Stealth can be upgraded from a d8 to a d10 or from a d10 to a d12 in this way. 
- You acquire an additional Stealth skill specialty of your choice. 
- You may switch weapons without spending an action as long as both weapons are ranged or lack the two-handed property. 
- You leave virtually no trace of your passage. Attempts to detect your presence in an area you have visited with Investigation or Perception checks are made at disadvantage, as are attempts to track you with Survival. 
- When you apply Hunter’s Target, you become invisible until the beginning of your next turn. 
- When you use Swift Feet, you become immune to non-magical difficult terrain for the duration of the feature. 

### Deadly Shadow 
***Prerequisite:** Whisper Foot feat* <br>
You are an unquestioned master of stealth. Your enemies would doubt your existence if not for the number of them you had laid low. You gain the following benefits: 
- Your Sneak Attack die increases by one step against your Studied Adversaries to a maximum of d10. 
- While you are hidden, you may teleport up to your movement speed to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
