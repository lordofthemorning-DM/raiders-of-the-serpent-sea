In the traditions of many worlds, there is a belief in an early, primeval, state of the world. It is a belief that beings from this long ago can be harnessed, bargained with, or exploited by powerful spellcasters with varying degrees of success... and often tragic results. To this day some raider wizards have drawn a boundary between what is to be known and what must be forgotten. These seekers search the world, destroying ancient tomes and desecrating powerful artifacts—and killing those that hold onto such powers. 

Among every clan there might be seekers alongside other casters, often presenting themselves as a shield between the clan and other arcane practitioners. Not that it matters, for most raiders dislike any and all arcane casters due to their association with the magic of Mirgal. Owing to this, most raider wizards are isolated and surly. Outside of the training of their apprentices, wizards (and witches, sorcerers, and warlocks) only meet their peers at the octennial gathering of the clans. Otherwise, they seldom interact, except to battle one another. 

### Arcane Warden
You oppose the reckless arcane casters (dreamer witches in particular) and stop them from unleashing the magic you fear may consume Grimnir as it did the Lost Lands. Your training with the arcane is devoted to seeking out and over-whelming other wizards.
You gain proficiency with light armor and two weapons of your choice.
You are skilled with tracking down opponents and deciphering the secrets of their lairs. You gain proficiency with the Investigation skill, an expertise die if already proficient, and may always use your Intelligence score on Investigation checks. You may also use an action (and expend a spell slot) to sense every arcane wielder of magic within 1 mile of you and you know their relative direction in relation to where you currently are. This effect lasts for 2 hours, allowing you to track down all but the most elusive of enemies.

### Forestalling
Those that study the primal have a way of seeing the connections between the past and the future, or between individuals. These connections are imagined as knotted cords and with experience, a primal wizard can see and understand many such connections and use this knowledge to further their own actions. At 6th level, you become able to influence the future, based on your understanding of the past.
You remove an enemy’s power in the present by having them forget something important from their past. After hitting an opponent with a ranged or melee attack, you may use your bonus action to try to disrupt their spellcasting. If the target fails an Intelligence saving throw (with the DC equal to your spell save DC) they lose a prepared spell from their list.  If they do not prepare spells, you instead cause them to forget a spell known until they finish a long rest. If they have cast a particular spell on their previous turn, you may pick that spell to be removed. Otherwise, the spell removed is selected at random:
- Lower-level spells are removed before higher level spells.
- Innate spellcasting is also affected. Lower power spells (such as 3/day) are removed before more powerful spells (such as 1/day).

### Turn of Fate
At 10th level, your knowledge of the knotted cords has increased, better preparing you to weather the hazards of Grimnir.
You add *dispel magic* and *counterspell* to your spellbook if they are not already there.  These spells are always prepared and do not count against your number of prepared spells, and you add an expertise die to any spellcasting ability checks made with either spell.

### Spellcurse

By 14th level, both dreamers and seekers have gained tremendous expertise that serves them well, especially in trials of arcane combat. 

**Dreamer.** You have become very proficient at working your way through the fate cords affecting you. When you fail a concentration check you may use your reaction to immediately cast another spell that requires concentration. You must have a valid spell available to cast and its normal casting time must be no longer than one action. If these conditions are met, you automatically succeed with the concentration check and are now maintaining both spells. Subsequent concentration checks are made with disadvantage while you are concentrating on both spells. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Seeker.** You have refined your ability to prevent rival spellcasters from unleashing deadly magic on the battlefield. When you damage a target with a spell, you can use a bonus action to afflict the target with a spellcurse. While afflicted with the curse, the target is not aware of it and the first time they attempt to cast any spell (including innate spellcasting) they must make a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. If they fail the check, the spell fails, and they lose the ability to cast that particular spell for the remainder of the day. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and you regain expended uses after a long rest.
