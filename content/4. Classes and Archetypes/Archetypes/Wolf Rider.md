In the deep snow-covered forests, the clan of the Whar has existed since Grimnir’s founding. Decades ago, though capable sailors, their skill in battle shone brightest when astride the great horses that formed their cavalry. For generations they were unstoppable, though many credited their worship of the goddess, Hel, for their successes. They were feared, both among the raiders and the other peoples of the world. Yet over the past few generations their victories have dwindled, as have their numbers. Feeding their herds became impossible and many of their youth found their way to sea, to other clans. They eventually lost their seat in the inner council. But change is afoot in the world of Grimnir again. And it all began with the wolves. These creatures, mere legends from the Lost Lands, have reappeared. Gifted, so it appears, by the Lady of the Dead to her most faithful of worshipers, the Whar. The wolves have upset the existing clan hierarchy because those the wolves select as partners are instantly elevated in the clan leadership. Newer voices are being heard, as these wolf riders take their place. “The wolf decides,” is a saying often uttered. You, as a wolf rider, seek glory for a re-emerging Whar clan, and desire to honor Hel, the Lady of the Dead, with heroic deeds. You are part of a pack, destined to never fight alone.

### Wolf Companion
At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the Beast Friend knack if you don’t already know it with the following changes: 
- Your wolf companion always has the stats of a Grimnir wolf .
- Your wolf companion shares your initiative and acts after you.
- Your wolf companion’s Armor Class is increased by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
In addition, whenever your wolf rolls initiative or finishes a short or long rest, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your level multiplied by your proficiency bonus. You may use a bonus action to command your wolf to act (see Bonded below).

### Bonded
At 3rd level, your wolf and you share a limited telepathy, with a range of 120 feet and it can communicate its feelings and intent to you. You may command your wolf to move or take the dash, disengage, or dodge actions as long as you are not incapacitated and it can see or hear you.  As a bonus action you may command it to take other actions, including the attack action.
Furthermore your wolf can act to defend itself or you if you are incapable of giving them commands. In such cases the narrator determines its exact behavior. If it has been attacked since its previous turn, it may take either the the attack action against a creature that attacked it, the dodge action, or the disengage action and move away from the creature attacking them. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or attacked while incapacitated, it may also move to and attack the creature doing so. It may take attacks of opportunity without command.
When you command your wolf to take a particular action it gains additional benefits:
- The Attack Action. Your wolf adds your proficiency bonus to it's attack and damage rolls.  If at level 18 you take the Beastly Attack feature, this also apply to attacks made as part of that ability in addition to those you command with a bonus action.
- The Dodge action. In addition to its usual effects, when your wolf takes the Dodge action, it helps to confuse opponents attacking you. Any attack rolls against you are now made with disadvantage until the start of your next turn as long as the wolf remains within 10 feet of you. 
- The Help action. When you command your wolf to use a Help action to assist you in combat against a specific creature, you improve your chance of scoring a critical hit. Your critical hit range for that attack becomes a 19-20, or increases by 1 if already a 19-20 or better to a maximum of 17-20..

### Woodland Rider
At 5th level your wolf grows into an adult Grimnir wolf and can now be used as a mount (and does not require a saddle). The time spent training together has also made the two of you more effective in combat. While mounted on your wolf you both gain the following benefits:
- Whenever an attack misses you or your wolf, you or your wolf can use a reaction to move the wolf up to half its speed without either of you provoking an attack of opportunity.
- Mounting or dismounting costs 10 feet of movement (not half your speed) and you have advantage to avoid falling off your mount.
- You and the wolf have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Pack Leader
At 7th level your training continues. Your wolf and you become more adept at fighting together. Your wolf’s attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
You also have the following new bonus actions:
- Wall of Fur. Pick a direction. You use your wolf to grant you total cover (can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, but you also cannot target creatures on the other side) until the beginning of your next turn. This ends early if you and your wolf are ever more than 5 feet apart.  When doing so, you also lose the half cover you normally get against melee attacks while mounted if the attack is coming form a different direction.
- Combat Assist. Your wolf uses its Help action to assist you in combat and, if you hit, the wolf may use a reaction to make a free bite attack against that same creature.  This bite adds your proficiency bonus to it's attack and damage rolls as if you had commanded it.
- Near Shot. You do not suffer disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks, even when within 5 feet of an opponent (as long as your wolf is within 10 feet of the target.)

### Dangerous Beast
At 11th level your wolf grows into a Grimnir frost wolf or Grimnir forest wolf (your choice).

### Defend the Pack
Starting at 15th level, if you or your wolf scores a critical hit against an enemy, you may move up to half your movement and use your reaction to attack another target within range. This feature does not expend your movement, and both you and your wolf can move if you are mounted on it.
