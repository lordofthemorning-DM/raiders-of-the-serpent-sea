The following additional Divine Lessons are allowed:

### HOSPITALLER 
You gain proficiency with Medicine, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. You can always use Charisma when making Medicine checks. 
### KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT 
You have learned to separate the genuinely dangerous from the merely transgressive and provocative. You gain proficiency with the Arcana skill or an expertise die if you are already proficient. You also gain the aberrations and forbidden lore Arcana skill specialties. You can always use Charisma when making Arcana checks. 
### KNOW THINE ENEMY 
When you make a check using a lore skill to recall information about a creature that is of a type you could detect with your Divine Sense, you are always treated as proficient with a relevant skill. If you are already proficient with a skill that could be used to discover or learn information about the creature, you gain advantage on the check instead. 
### LEAP OF FAITH 
Your long jump distance increases by 10 feet and your high jumps are increased by 5 feet. You only need 5 feet of movement to initiate a long jump. 
### REVERENT ARMORER 
You gain proficiency with your choice of either smith’s tools or sewing kits and an expertise die on checks to repair weapons and armor. When you repair a suit of armor, you can spend a point from your Lay on Hands pool to bless it. The wearer can spend an action to invoke the blessing, gaining one of the following benefits: 
- The armor sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius for one hour. 
- The armor gains the comfortable trait for one long rest. <br>
If the wearer is reduced to 0 hit points with the blessing in place, they receive an expertise die on their first death saving throw. The blessing dissipates if the wearer removes the armor or finishes a long rest. Alternatively, you can spend an hour working with an intact suit of armor to impart the blessing. You may only have one such blessing active at a time. 
### RIDE LIKE HEAVEN 
You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks, and you can channel healing power into your mount, soothing tired muscles and calming its pounding heart, allowing it to briefly exceed its normal limits. While riding a mount, you can spend 10 Lay on Hands points to allow your mount to move at a gallop speed for an additional hour. Once a given mount has been affected by this feature, it cannot be affected again until it has finished a long rest. 
### SENSE HAZARD 
Your Divine Sense can warn you of environmental hazards. Depending on which creature type pair you are attuned to, you can sense if you are within a mile of an area of a hazard or hazards associated with those types as indicated below. In order for this feature to work, “hazard” is defined by qualifying for the encounter element listed; this will not pick up a candle flame, a bottle of vinegar, someone’s magnetized compass needle, an icebox, or other innocuous, typically non-hazardous occurrences of these conditions. You also know the general directions (compass points) of any hazards detected. 
- Celestials and Fiends. Acid, extreme heat, fire, lava, memory crystals 
- Fey and Elementals. Acid, extreme cold, extreme heat, fire, lava, poisonous plants 
- Aberrations and Undead. High gravity, low gravity, magnetized ore, miring ground, vacuum.
### SHOULDER THE BURDEN 
Your carrying capacity is treated as if your Strength score was 2 points higher than it is and you can carry an additional bulky item.
