Stormborn sorcerers are those for whom the thundering, howling, electric power of the storm thrums through their very veins.  They can draw about this inner tempest as a source of powerful magic.  Some have tempers and personalities as tempestuous as their magic, while others are strangely calm and disciplined, having trained themselves to live as the eye of the storm.

#### Stormborn Archetype Spells
1st level: *air wave, arcane riposte, create or destroy water, thunderwave* <br>
3rd level: *gust of wind, levitate, shatter, sleet storm* <br>
5th level: *call lightning, crushing haymaker, whirlwind kick, wind wall* <br>
7th level: *blight, conjure minor elementals* (water or air only), *control water, ice storm*

9th level: *cone of cold, conjure elemental* (water or air only), *hold monster, storm kick*

### Raging Tempest
At 1st level you can spend 1 sorcery point as a bonus action to be carried by the wind, flying 15 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.  If you do so ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.
In addition, at 2nd level you must choose the blizzard or hurricane manifestation, and at 12th level you must either improve that manifestation or choose the other one.

### The Calm Before
At 6th level when you roll initiative you may choose to do so with disadvantage.  If you do so, you regain sorcery points equal to half your proficiency bonus.  Once you have done so you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Resist Elements
At 14th level you gain an expertise die on Strength and Constitution saving throws.  You also gain resistance to your choice of lightning, cold, or thunder damage.  You can change the damage type whenever you finish a long rest.  If you would take damage of one of the types you are not resistant to, you may spend 2 sorcery points as a reaction to also gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn.

### Ride the Storm
At 18th level you gain a flying speed of 80 feet while outdoors.  In addition, if you are outdoors and it is stormy weather, any spell you cast that deals thunder, lightning, or cold damage adds your Charisma modifier to one of its damage rolls.
