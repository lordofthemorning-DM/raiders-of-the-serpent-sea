The following additional Arcane Innovations are allowed:

### 90% PERSPIRATION 
*Prerequisites: Corrosion Manifestation* 
You can release acidic sweat from your skin corrosive enough to dissolve non-magical material or burn creatures. You are immune to the acid you produce. The acid’s potency is determined by the time spent producing the dose: The sweat may be collected and stored in a glass vial, but it loses its potency and can no longer dissolve material after 24 hours. Once you use this feature for a total of 10 minutes, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest. 
### ANTI-VENOM 
*Prerequisites: Venom Manifestation* 
You can spit out an antidote for a specific poison after identifying it and resisting its effects. To identify it you may use an action to touch and taste a small amount of the poison and make a saving throw against the poison with advantage. On a success you produce and spit out enough antidote doses to heal 1d4 poisoned creatures. On a failure you suffer the effects of the poison, but after 1 minute you can still produce 1 dose of the antidote. The antidote loses its potency and can no longer counteract the poison after 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest. 
### ARCANE VIGILANCE 
You learn the alarm spell, which becomes a sorcerer spell for you, and you may cast it as a ritual. When you cast this spell, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see who will hear the silent alarm when it goes off. BREATHLESS You can spend a minute respirating normally and focusing on your breath. For the following hour you do not need to breathe. 
### CLAIRVOYANCE ENOUGH 
You cast your gaze inward, and a hidden place reveals itself to you. Name a specific, immovable location on the same plane that you are seeking and spend 1 sorcery point. After 10 minutes of continuous focus, you know the distance and direction of the location from your current position. By spending an additional sorcery point you also learn of one previously unknown obstacle that stands between you and the destination. At the Narrator’s discretion, information about this obstacle may range from cryptic or crystal clear. Spending any additional points on subsequent uses of this feature does not reveal any additional obstacles but may yield new information about the obstacle. 
### CRUISE CONTROL 
You can spend 1 sorcery point to touch a vehicle and pilot it along your intended course for up to 8 hours while you rest. During this time you still gain the benefits of completing the rest. Living creatures that are required to pull, push, or otherwise propel a vehicle (e.g the oxen for an ox-drawn wagon) are considered to be resting as well. The vehicle will follow the path you predetermined (e.g. road, waterway, or heading towards a destination) but will not avoid obstacles that you were unaware of prior to taking your rest. For example if you are aware of a large pothole on the road ahead or rocky outcrop in the sea, the vehicle will go around it, but if you are unaware that a bridge further on has been burned down or that a kraken has recently surfaced along your ocean route, the vehicle will make no attempt to change course. You cannot stop the vehicle, use a vehicle action, or change course without interrupting your rest. 
### EYES OF THE STORM 
*Prerequisites: Hurricane Manifestation* 
You can accurately predict the next 24 hours of non-magical weather in your current location, and you have advantage on checks to navigate, find shelter, hunt, or gather in fog or inclement weather (e.g. heavy precipitation or strong winds).
### ICY HOT 
*Prerequisites: Blizzard or Inferno Manifestation* 
You gain one of the following features based on your manifestation energy. You can spend 1 sorcery point to share the benefits of this feature with all creatures that remain within 10 feet of you for 1 hour.
- Calm, Cool, Collected (Blizzard). You are resistant to heat for the purposes of overcoming hot weather and extremely high temperatures. 
- Hot Blooded (Inferno). You are resistant to cold for the purposes of overcoming cold weather and extremely low temperatures. 
### OTHERWORLDLY KINSHIP 
Choose one of the following creature types: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. You can always choose to use Charisma on Insight checks against creatures of the chosen type, and you can always understand what they say or choose to make yourself understood by them, even if you do not otherwise share a language. In addition, you may spend 1 sorcery point to gain these benefits against another one of the listed creature types for 1 hour. 
### SKY WALK 
*Prerequisites: Magnetic Step Innovation* 
You can use Magnetic Step at your normal Speed and can step on thin air as if it were solid ground. If you end your turn in the air, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support yourself. 
### SORCEROUS WAYS 
While traveling, you can spend 1 sorcery point per hour (up to a maximum of 4 hours) to shorten the distance between point A and point B. The distance you and your party cover at a normal travel pace or slower is doubled. Once you use this feature, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest. 
### STRENGTH 
WITHIN Your innate connection to magic allows you to overcome your physical limitations. You can always use Charisma for Athletics checks, and you can likewise use Charisma to calculate your jump distance, carrying capacity, and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. If you know the arcane muscles cantrip, it grants you an expertise die on Athletics checks instead of allowing you to use Charisma for Athletics checks. However, you cannot grant an expertise die to an Athletics check using the friends cantrip unless you could use Charisma on the check even without this feature. 
### THIRD-EYE SIGHT 
You use an action to trace the outline of an eye on your forehead with your finger. The outline glows faintly for 4 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Each time you use this feature choose one effect which lasts for the duration: 
- You have darkvision out to 60 feet. 
- You cast directional light: bright light out to a 30- foot cone and dim light out to a 90-foot cone. You can use a bonus action to turn the light off or on. 
- You touch the forehead of one willing creature that has eyes and connect with it for the duration. While connected, you can use an action to focus on the creature, becoming blind to your own surroundings and seeing through the creature’s eyes instead, gaining any special, vision-based senses it has. You must use your action each turn to maintain this connection. If you or the creature travel more than 1 mile apart from one another, your connection breaks, ending this feature early. 
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
