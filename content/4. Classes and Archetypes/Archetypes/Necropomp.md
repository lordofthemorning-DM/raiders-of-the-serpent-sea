The necropomp is a cleric in service to gods and forces of death and the afterlife.  Some are vicious and cruel necromancers who inspire devotion through terror, others hunters of the undead that track down and destroy these abominations.  Some serve gods of murder and bloody sacrifice; others are living psychopomps who run hospices, perform funeral rites, and help guide all those near death or recently departed.  Still others are dark avengers, bringing ruin and retribution, plague and divine punishment down upon the unrighteous.  All are deeply in tune with death.

### Steward of the Mortal Gates
At 1st level you learn the *chill touch* and *spare the dying* cantrips if you do not know them already.  You may cast *spare the dying* as a bonus action with a range of 30 feet.  In addition, when you cast *spare the dying* you may instead choose to heal the target for 1 hit point. You may do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
In addition, the Funeral and Guide the Passing effects of the *ceremony* spell as well as the *gentle repose* spell last twice as long as normal, and the Funeral option lasts indefinitely against undead of CR 1 or lower.

### Channel Divinity: Creeping Death
At 2nd level you may use your Channel Divinity to mark a creature you can see within 30 feet for death. This mark lasts for 1 minute. The marked creature cannot regain hit points and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.  At the start of each of their turns they must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage.  This damage increases to 2d6 at level 8 and 2d8 at level 17.  If a creature dies while so marked, you may choose to have the mark jump to a new creature if your choice you can see within 30 feet of the creature that died.  If you do so, increase the remaining duration by a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier to a maximum of 1 minute.  A *greater restoration, heal, mass heal*, or similar magic ends the effect on a creature.
### Lord of the Unliving
At 6th level you gain an additional two Empowered Turning options.  These must be chosen from Command Undead or Destroy Undead.  In addition, all undead creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your attempts to turn, command, or destroy them.
### Rise or Rest
At 8th level, when you kill a living creature, you may cast either the *animate dead* or *gentle repose* spells on them as a bonus action.  You may cast these spells in this way a combined number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.  You must still expend a spell slot as normal.
### Fear the Reaper
At 17th level you become a true harbinger of death.  You ignore necrotic resistance and treat immunity to necrotic damage as resistance.  In addition, you add the *circle of death* and *finger of death* spells to your list of Necropomp spells.
