House Rules

You may command your bear to move or take the dash, disengage, or dodge actions as long as you are not incapacitated and it can see or hear you.  A bonus action is only required to command it to take other actions.  When you command it to attack, it adds your proficiency bonus to its attack and damage rolls instead of replacing its bonus, and it does so even when not raging.

Furthermore your bear can act to defend itself or you if you are incapable of giving them commands. In such cases the narrator determines its exact behavior. If it has been attacked since its previous turn, it may take either the the attack action against a creature that attacked it, the dodge action, or the disengage action and move away from the creature attacking them. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or attacked while incapacitated, it may also move to and attack the creature doing so. It may take attacks of opportunity without command. Anytime it attacks without you commanding it to do so, it does not add your proficiency bonus to attack or damage rolls.
