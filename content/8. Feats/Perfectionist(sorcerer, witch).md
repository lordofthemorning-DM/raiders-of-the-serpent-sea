### Perfectionist 
***Prerequisite:** 3 witch and 3 sorcerer* <br>
As witches revere magic in all it’s forms and often seem to have deeper insights into it’s underlying mysteries and nature than other practitioners, sorcerers and others born or gifted innate talent for magic often turn to witchcraft to better understand and improve themselves. You gain the following benefits: 
- You gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20. 
- If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not Charisma, you may change it to Charisma. 
- You may freely take any sorcerer arcane innovation whenever you would gain a magical mystery, or a magical mystery anytime you would gain an arcane innovation, and add half your sorcerer level to your witch level for the purpose of magical mysteries. 
- You can spend sorcery points to temporarily gain a spell from the witch or sorcerer spell lists. Temporarily gaining a spell in this way costs a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level. You cannot gain a spell in this way that has a level higher than your highest level spell slot. When you gain a witch spell in this way, it is considered prepared for the day. When you gain a sorcerer spell in this way, it is considered a spell you know for the day. You lose all spells gained in this way whenever you finish a long rest.

### Spell-blooded 
***Prerequisite:** Perfectionist feat* <br>
Your hard work, studies, and instruction have unlocked new depths within the magic that flows through your veins, giving an unparalleled ability to manipulate the raw underlying essence of magic. You gain one of the following manifestation options depending on which option you chose for your Witch Magic feature: 
- ***White Magic.*** Higher Arcanum (radiant): When you cast a spell that deals radiant damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6 × the spell’s level, or half that amount and also cures any diseases they are suffering from and removes any of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. 
- ***Black Magic.*** Lower Arcanum (necrotic): When you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you may spend 2 sorcery points and choose one creature you can see. If the creature takes necrotic damage from the spell, they reduce their maximum hit points by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt and must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they gain 1d4 strife or fatigue levels (your choice). Once you successfully inflict fatigue or strife on a creature using this manifestation you may not do so again in a single 24 hour period, though you may apply both fatigue and strife to them on separate casts. 
- ***Gray Magic.*** Balanced Arcanum (force): When you cast a spell that deals force damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points and choose one creature you can see. If the creature takes force damage from the spell, it makes an Strength saving throw or is pushed 10ft directly away from you, knocked prone, or both. On a critical failure or a failure by 5 or more they are also stunned until the end of their next turn. <br>
You also upgrade one of your standard sorcerer manifestations to its evolved form. 

### Weaver of Mystic Strands 
***Prerequisite:** Spell-blooded feat* <br>
Your ability to understand and directly affect the fundamental stuff of magic, whether your own or that used by others, is unmatched. You gain the following benefits: 
- You know the counterspell and dispel magic spells. These count as sorcerer spells that do not count against your number of sorcerer spells known, and you know them even if your sorcerer level is not normally high enough to know 3rd level spells. 
- Anytime you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or successfully dispel a spell with dispel magic, you may use your reaction to regain sorcery points equal to 1/2 the level of the spell you dispelled or saved against. If you successfully counter a spell with counterspell, you may immediately regain sorcery points equal to 1/2 the level of the spell you countered as part of the same reaction, minimum 1, but only if the original caster does not use their reaction to use the lingering magic to cast a different spell. 
- When you convert a spell slot into sorcery points, you gain sorcery points equal to the level of the converted spell slot+1.
