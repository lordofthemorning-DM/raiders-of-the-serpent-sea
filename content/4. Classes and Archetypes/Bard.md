The following additional Adventuring Tricks are allowed:
#### BLEND INTO CROWD 
You easily fit in wherever you go. You gain proficiency with Stealth. If you are already proficient with Stealth, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, in any urban environment, such as a city estate, guard barracks, or guild hall, people just assume you belong. You automatically succeed on any check to impersonate a basic worker, servant, or low level member of an organization and are granted any privileges and access such a person would have unless there is an obvious reason you don’t belong (such as being the wrong creature type or the organization being so small that everyone knows each other by name). 
#### GREAT ARTISTS STEAL 
You gain proficiency with checks using a forgery kit. If you are already proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, your prestige increases by 1 as you claim other great artists’ work as your own while maintaining plausible deniability with the general public. Of course, you may draw the ire from the artists you steal from or those who closely follow their work. 
#### MUSICAL SAVANT 
You gain an expertise die on checks with any musical instrument you are proficient in (including any musical instrument proficiencies you gain in the future). You may learn or teach an instrument proficiency in half the usual time using the Train downtime activity and suffer no penalties for not having a tutor. 
#### NAMELESS 
Your name is writ in water, and people easily forget your face despite any current fame you may currently enjoy. By taking 1 minute of preparation, you remove signifying details people usually associate you with (such as glasses, a scarf, or an outlandish outfit) and assume an alter ego who is totally forgettable. Anyone outside of close friends and contacts must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to attempt to remember your name, alias, or specific details about you; on a failure they remember only the most basic details but nothing sufficient to easily identify you, and they may not attempt another check until they encounter you again. Your Glory while assuming this alter ego is always treated as 0.
#### PARABLE 
You gain an expertise die on Performance checks. In addition, you can spend at least 1 minute telling a story, which allows you to substitute Performance for any Persuasion or Deception check made to convince someone to follow a course of action provided you can plausibly tie it into the moral of the story.
#### SHOWSTOPPER 
*Prerequisites: 13th level, d8 expertise die on Performance checks.* 
Your expertise on Performance checks increases to 1d10. You may use Performance in place of an Intimidation check when convincing opponents to surrender or stand down from battle. 
#### REQUIEM 
You can perform a 10 minute song over a corpse as part of a special ceremony. Make a DC 15 Performance check; on a success you learn whether the target died of natural causes, by accident, or was murdered. You may learn other details at the Narrator’s discretion. 
#### RESONATING KEY 
Your music has percussive force. You gain an expertise die on either Performance checks or any check with a musical instrument. You may use Performance or a musical instrument proficiency in place of a Strength check to break bonds, burst open doors, and shatter glass and may always use Charisma for this roll.
