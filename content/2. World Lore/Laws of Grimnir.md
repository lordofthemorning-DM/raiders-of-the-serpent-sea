There are fewer laws in the world of Grimnir than in many other adventure settings. In general, might makes right. Still, some boundaries have been established. All out bloodshed between clans is minimized, both by the völv and by the jarls, especially in these troubling times.

In general, a killing, outside of warfare, for no valid reason, can be tried by the jarl of either the victim or the aggressor. Often the killer is forced to pay coin or land to the victim’s family. When disagreement or conflict occurs between jarls, the völv step in to prevent a war. These interventions often wait until the Gathering, but jarls have been known to sail with their clans to the Well of Wisdom so that judgment might be pronounced more swiftly.

For less urgent issues, the clans keep an accounting of transgressions that they then tally during the Gathering at Drifthall, in long meetings with the other jarls, all adjudicated by the völv.

### Oaths
Oaths may be sworn for a variety of reasons. Though most are only judged by other mortals, some catch the ears of the gods—or primal powers—and become ever more binding. However, for both mortal and immortal, the bending of words, the outwitting of a rival through a cleverly worded oath, is respected... and anticipated.

#### Oath of Duty

In cases of severe judgment, a raider might be forced to agree to an oath of duty to their victim, or the victim’s family. Such an oath might also be taken voluntarily, either to repay a debt or to express appreciation. At the naming of the oath, both parties agree to the length of time for which the oath holds.

Failure to take—or honor—the oath results in the transgressor suffering the curse of the exile.

#### Oath of Fellowship

In times of trouble even rival clans must come together. When needed, a group will swear fellowship to one another and promise to defend each other, share glory and spoils, and to never act against the others. At least while the terms of the fellowship are valid.

Failure to uphold this oath results in the transgressor becoming afflicted with the curse of the exile.

#### Oath of Retribution

When wronged, a raider’s wrath knows no limits. A raider may declare a bloodvow against an enemy that has insulted or injured them. This is a ritual, but one undertaken by the wronged raider, alone. Often the ritual involves a long rest in the deep woods and an offering of their blood or flesh to Grimnir. The GM will decide the actual benefits and drawbacks of this oath, but the following provides examples:

- **Words Have Power.** The more specific a vow, the more power it holds. Declaring, “I shall slay every raider of the Tvar Clan”, might merit a +1 to all attack rolls against Tvar raiders. Uttering instead, “I shall kill Gunthur of the Tvar” might merit a +3 to all attack rolls against Gunthur. “I shall kill Gunthur of the Tvar by the next full moon” could merit +3 to attack rolls and +3 to damage against Gunthur himself.
- **Flesh Has Power.** The benefit of the oath can be increased with a sacrifice of flesh. A finger or toe might grant advantage against the first attack against the targeted foe(s). A hand or eye might grant disadvantage to all attacks from the named enemy.
- **Retribution Knows No Rest.** Any exhaustion (no matter the source) during the fulfillment of the oath is ignored with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
- **Time Has Limits.** There must be a time limit (no more than a year) and if that limit expires and vengeance has not been obtained, the raider suffers the curse of failed promises.

### Curses
As with oaths, some curses are enforced by mortals and others by the gods and powers of the world.

#### Curse of the Exile

This curse is enacted by other mortals. The cursed raider becomes marked by all other raiders, who must now ignore them. The cursed will be treated as if they have already died and no one will shelter, feed, or defend them. This curse guarantees exile or a death, albeit a slow one.

#### Curse of Failed Promises

A broken vow can often lead to the disapproval of the Stone Court itself. The cursed immediately suffers one permanent level of exhaustion (able to only be removed by the casting of a greater restoration spell, on eight consecutive days) and a sacrifice of flesh no smaller than a finger. Unless removed, another level of exhaustion is gained every eight days. A character that dies of this curse arises as a draugr under the control of the game master.![[laws.jpg]]
