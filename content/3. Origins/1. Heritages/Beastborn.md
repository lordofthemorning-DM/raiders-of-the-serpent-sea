> _"How I miss Barl… the old caretaker to the Well. He was always hunched over, but still seemed tall to me. I remember his big, ursine face, smiling down at me. A good man, he treated me (despite my own differences) with such kindness. Maybe we shared that, being different. I felt so safe with him. But he grew old too fast and one day he just wandered back into the woods…"_

Once an ordinary animal living a content life in the forests, seas, or skies of Grimnir, the beastborn became enamored with raiders, their villages, their ships, and gradually, day after day, they started to act like them. Started to become them.

The beastborn strongly resembles the creature it once was, though no matter its original size, it has grown (or shrunk) to roughly human height. They look like an animal that has simply decided to walk upright, emulating the raiders they admire. 

### Intensely Curious

When the beastborn first saw raiders in their sleek ships and clever towns, they caught a glimpse of a world beyond their forests and plains, their seas and skies. They started to think differently. They lingered on the fringes of raider villages, watching, learning… wondering.

And then one day… Well, it happens differently for each beastborn, but more or less they decide. They decide to take the shape of the raiders they see. And they just do.

For a beastborn, Grimnir is an amazing place. They appreciate this more than most for they understand both the wonders of the natural world (the comfort and joy of simply surviving amidst the beautiful forests and mountains and seas) as well as the more complicated marvels of civilization. They long to make the most of their short life and learn and see all that they can.

### Torn Between Two Worlds

Though curious about the raiders they admire, they are also deeply attached to their own kind. The struggle to belong to both groups can be hard, but ultimately rewarding. Their two worlds offer lessons well worth learning. Though they have learned the language of their new community, they have not forgotten how to speak (and to listen) to others of their kind.

### The One and Only

The beastborn can live within either animal or humanoid communities, but each individual has never met another being similar to themselves. But that has seldom presented any problems for them. Though they often look quite bestial, other raiders never really see them as they truly are. The magic of Grimnir softens their roughest features.

### Beastborn Names

Beastborn take great care to pick a name that fits their appearance or personality. Usually, these names are compounds words with two or more phrases spelling out the name. Companions will often shorten or adjust these names to a suitable nickname.

**Names:** Big-Horn, Book-Reader, Drowsy-Boat, Gleaming-Mane, Lake-Talker, Never-Falls, Running-Fast, Smells-Better, Twitching-Ears, Wide-Shoulders.

### Beastborn Traits

Beastborn have the following traits.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid. 
- **Age.** You are only a few years old and will age quickly, reaching old age by thirty.
- **Size.** You are Medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Beast Speak.** You can communicate with other creatures of your original kind.
- **Unique.** There is no one else quite like you in all the world—never has been, never will be. Use the becoming beastborn system below to construct a beastborn of Grimnir. 

### Becoming Beastborn

The first step is to decide why you awakened and which beastborn aspects resonate most with you. 

Perhaps you are:

- A boar that seeks out knowledge, collecting and reading tomes from across the world, learning as much about the raiders and their past as is possible.
- A squirrel who wants to feel the thrill of leading a raiding party across the sea.
- A goat that craves to not only learn the culture of the raiders but is excited to add to it—composing great ballads to be sung in feast halls across Grimnir.

Once you have a vision in mind start spending the points.

### Beast Features

Choose your beast type from these three options: Hunter & Gatherer, Fish, and Fowl.

You start with a pool of 10 beast points. You spend points to acquire features and craft your own unique heritage gift. Any beastborn can purchase from the beast features, below. You may also purchase from the list associated with your beast type (but not from the lists belonging to other beast types). For your paragon gift, you gain an additional 7 points worth of features.
