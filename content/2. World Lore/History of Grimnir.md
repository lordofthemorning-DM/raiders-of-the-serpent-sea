Inspired by the stories told of Viking seafarers, and the myths and narratives important to those explorers, this book will help you build a rich Viking-themed world. Set in Grimnir, a world born from the destruction of the Lost Lands, the raiding clans compete against and exploit one another in their drive to survive amidst many deadly perils.

The campaign is designed for the 5th Edition of the world’s greatest roleplaying game. It starts with 4-6 heroes of 1st level and will take them on a journey across storm-tossed seas, through haunted forests, into ancient ruins, and toward lands never explored by the living, as they journey to 20th level or even higher. While sailing the Serpent Sea they may witness vast herds of furred beasts stampeding along icy coastlines, volcanoes rising unexpectedly to birth new islands before their eyes, or inland forests quivering and shaking as giants prepare raiding parties of their own.

Raiders of the Serpent Sea has a primary epic narrative divided into four main acts but with numerous opportunities for players to build longships, conquer settlements, and even assemble their own clan to stand against their foes at the end of the world.

In the beginning, a fate rune is cast by the raider seers (known as the völv) for every soul braving the world of Grimnir. Each hero must embrace that fate to save this world during the inevitable final battle—even if the sacrifices they must make are cruel, unfair, and devastating. Heroes in Grimnir persevere against overwhelming odds and devastating setbacks. Only the bold shall succeed.

And yet… even if the world is saved, how the heroes save it forever alters the future.

## History of Grimnir

#### Birthed by Primal Magic

Centuries ago, upon a vast, beautiful, and wondrous world, the Yoten warred with the heroic Vanir. The Yoten’s leader, [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða]], used might and treachery to force her way across those fabled lands till the Vanir were left defending a single settlement. They made their stand within that walled city, defending all that remained of their past, their beliefs, their very way of life.

At [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða's]] side stood [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], whose earlier betrayals had already weakened his former Vanir allies. In exchange for the power [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða]] offered, [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] had become her consort and the architect of the Lost Lands’ utter destruction. At the bloody climax of the battle, [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal's]] own creations—a feral wolf the size of a long-ship, a sinewy serpent capable of disintegrating opponents with her poison, and many others—joined the fray. Scores perished against these hordes as the beasts clambered over city walls and slaughtered innocents.

  

> _I didn’t realize then how far my uncle’s blood would run, how deeply it would stain. It was not until after his world took my eye that I truly saw._  
> - Aldyhn of the Stone Court

Seeing the inevitable, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] (the leader of the Vanir, and niece to [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] himself) surged through the enemy lines and challenged her uncle. They fought furiously, but [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn's]] sword arm was powered by her devotion to her people, and she overwhelmed [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]]. However, his death was not enough to turn the battle as the Yoten swarmed like locusts around her. The end was inevitable.

So [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] did the impossible.

  
As [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] dropped to his knees in defeat, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] took hold of his spear in one hand, her blade in the other. Within the spear surged the magic her uncle wielded so irresponsibly. She uttered words of conjuring and the world shook as a portal ripped violently open. [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] then slit her uncle’s throat with the spear’s blade and spoke ancient words.

  
With these utterances, she sacrificed [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] to the forgotten gods that both the Yoten and Vanir worshipped. His dying breath and the primal magic fueling the portal birthed a new world. Though the magic seared her flesh, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] stood strong and ushered the last of the Vanir—and the innocents they protected—into these new lands even as rock and wind, tree and fire, were being formed and shaped before their eyes. As the last of the survivors fled the Lost Lands, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] did not look back as she stepped into Grimnir. 

  
Years pass.

  
### The Rise of the Stone Court

Grimnir is a hard land. The north is home to islands covered by ice and snow, battered continuously by frigid winds, whereas the lands to the south are inundated with volcanoes and jagged plains of lava rock. The Serpent Sea weaves between these two harsh extremities encircling the rough and tumble inner continents and an uncountable number of fractured islands. Grimnir was created from Mirgal’s sacrifice and it is said that the wizard’s guilt and anguish over his treachery and failure is why the world is so impossibly volatile.

  

After the Exodus, the hardy newcomers spread out and the Vanir eventually built their primary keep on the central continent, atop the mysterious mountain range they named Turnfjall. Each year these mountains rise ever taller, still growing, as if determined to reach some point in the sky for reasons not even gods might fathom. At the mountain’s summit the Vanir hid [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal's]] Rainbow Spear.

  
Once a year, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn's]] son, [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]], climbed the isolated and deadly valleys of Turnfjall to collect the amber apples that sustained the Vanir and provided them with their long lives. During those excursions, he once chanced upon a woman, named [[Hel, Lady of the Dead|Hel]], and fell in love with her. Each year the couple would meet, but one particularly cold spring morning, with winter’s grip still tight on the land, the woman asked him to bring different apples to the Vanir. Blinded by love, he consented and took them from her to feed to his people.

  
Upon biting into each apple, the other Vanir aged rapidly before [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir's]] eyes. Only through the use of a powerful spell did they avert immediate death, but to stay alive, they had to become something else. Their flesh hardened as each Vanir transformed into a living statue, forever trapped where they took that ill-fated bite. In this form they have remained, for centuries.

  
But this story was not yet finished.

  
[[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]] remained lost in mourning, perhaps for days, until a cold winter’s evening when his lover’s body was dragged into the clearing and dropped into the snow at his feet. Then his eyes opened, widened in horror. [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða]], the foul Yoten that had destroyed the Lost Lands, revealed herself with a hideous snarl. She seized the Rainbow Spear, intent on opening a portal to the Lost Lands, to bring her fellow Yoten into Grimnir.

It was not to be.

  

The young warrior rose and took hold of a magical scythe as he leapt at Boða. There, before the blind gaze of his mother, his friends, and his allies, he fought with a furious frenzy. Such a great blow did he land on the spear that he sundered the magical artifact into many pieces. [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða]] shrieked and flung herself at Thonir. The two, the last of the Vanir and the last of the Yoten, fought a final, epic battle that left both mortally wounded. They died together, their life blood staining the snowy fields of Grimnir.

  
Upon both their deaths, a violent storm of primal magic swept across Grimnir. The Vanir, though trapped in stone, were imbued with divinity, transformed into the gods now known as the Stone Court. Thonir’s lover also changed—rising from death, she descended into the bowels of the world to become the caretaker of those that die from unjust means… the [[Hel, Lady of the Dead|Lady of the Dead]], a being that all raiders respect but few worship.

And of [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]] himself?

  

The raiders believe he sits in the fabled Halls of the Slain—feasting, drinking, and training the bravest of raider warriors who have ever died in battle. He presides over the valkry, the winged warrior women who bring the worthy dead to the halls. It is said that when a new evil rises to threaten Grimnir, [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]] and the dead legends from the past, shall return to defend the people.

And so, it shall be.

  

> _I watched them die, so many of them. The Vanir, those great heroes, who bumped me on their knees, watched my first steps, and taught a stripling youth his first sword swings. The end of a legacy… no words quite capture the terribleness of it all. More than one world died that day._  
> – Thonir the Almost-God

  

#### Rise of the Witchking

The pieces of the Rainbow Spear have been scattered, hidden, and protected by the raider clans since those early days. The völv have prophesied that if the spear were ever to be made whole again, it shall signal Grimnir’s violent end. This has not deterred some from attempting the feat.

  

The raider territories are not the only mortal dominions in Grimnir. There are also the Baendur kingdoms. These peoples build their towns deep within the forests and hills of various islands dotting the Serpent Sea. They have learned not to invite the attention of the raiders and for the most part have kept to themselves. 

  

Three centuries ago, a wanderer emerged from the ironwood forests that grow along the northern shores of Turnfjall. Giant-like in stature and covered completely in living armor harvested from those eldritch trees, he called himself the Witchking and forced the Baendur to bend their knee to him. He united them and waged war upon the raiders. It became clear that his intent was to recover the pieces of the spear and through many bloody skirmishes he claimed several.

  

Only by uniting, were the raider clans able to overthrow the Witchking and end his influence on the Baendur. In so doing they seriously diminished the power that those inner kingdoms once wielded. The raiders called this first coming together the Gathering. And though the clans are still at strife with one another, the Gathering is held every eighth year. It is one of the most important elements holding raider society together.

The Witchking did not fall, however. His life has been prolonged by magic and he continues to thwart the intentions of the raiders, though he has never come quite so close to victory as he did three centuries past. Today he exerts his influence through his Ironwood Witches as they still attempt to unite the Rainbow Spear. Gradually, year by year, more and more of the pieces have disappeared from the raiders and found their way to the Witchking…

#### The Present Day

The past two winters have been devastating, with frigid winds and perpetual snow blowing across much of the land. Spring harvests have suffered as the winters have extended long past their welcome and fog and mist create an ever-present haze that weakens the sun from renewing the land. The people grow hungry and long for a return to normal, for an end to this Long Winter.

Not as immediately concerning as their empty stomachs are the flashes of light coming from atop Turnfjall. Most raiders have witnessed the sight, though usually these nocturnal events occur only during the fiercest of storms. Can it truly be a coincidence that strange beasts and creatures have claimed the darkened old forests?

The völv runes warn that the last age of mortals has begun. This “Twilight of the Vanir”, as the völv refer to it, signals an end to the world of Grimnir. Others use a simpler term from the long ago: Ragnarök.

In their visions, the völv have seen an abandoned tower, far to the south and long forgotten. They have sent a rare union of raiders from many different clans to investigate. Led by the war hero, Hrolf (a man respected by all clans), these heroes must determine if the fate runes have fallen crooked or level—does Ragnarök truly approach?

If so, then it falls upon these heroes to prevail against it. Else… another world shall be lost.
