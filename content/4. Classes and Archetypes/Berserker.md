House Rules

In addition to those listed in the link above, berserkers may also select the [[Beast Unity]] and [[Viper's Fangs]]  [[combat maneuvers|combat maneuver]] tradition.

An additional Furious Critical options is allowed: 
#### Furious Reflexes. 
When you critically hit a creature you gain an expertise die on the next dexterity save or dexterity check you make until the start of your next turn. 
In addition, you may now use it and any other Furious Critical options other than Knockdown Strike, Overbearing Blow, or Pinning Strike with any melee weapon, not just those with the heavy, two handed, or versatile properties.

At level 7 when you choose your Advanced Battle Defense, if you choose Enhanced Vitality you may apply it to all three mental scores rather than picking just one.

The following additional Developed Talents are allowed:
#### GENTLE SOUL 
Your nature may intimidate your enemies, but never your friends. Children and animals, as well as the very old, instinctually trust you, and you gain an expertise die on Persuasion and Animal Handling checks against them. Additionally, when you take this knack, you gain one minor skill or hobby, such as whittling, whistling, cooking, or knitting. When you make a Persuasion or Animal Handling check where you can apply that minor skill or hobby, your expertise die increases to 1d6. 
#### HARD LABOR HERO 
Your strength of will is respected in many trades. You may spend eight hours working with others at a trade where hard work and strength of personality are respected, such as logging, mining, or wrangling, to gain the ability to call on the other workers for one favor. The favor must be within your colleagues’ ability to perform, and they will not work against their own self-interest. Example favors include rallying a group to back you up when confronting a powerful individual, helping to construct (or deconstruct) a structure, spreading the news of your heroism around the community, or providing you with a critical piece of information about local affairs. If you do not call in this favor within a month, the goodwill dissipates. If you work for a week, the favor can be called in within six months; if you work for a month, the favor can be called in any time in the next year. 
#### HORSEMAN’S WORD 
*Prerequisites: 3rd level*
When an animal first encounters your might, you can cow them. When you grapple a creature with the beast creature type, you may spend a bonus action to whisper a threat into its ear. The creature understands the intent, if not the words, and must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, the creature becomes docile and biddable for ten minutes, after which it reverts to its normal behavior. While the creature is affected in this way, it will not attack and will follow commands that do not counteract its nature. If it takes damage or is commanded to act against its nature (such as asking a cow to cross a cattle guard), it makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.
#### IMPRESSIVE MIGHT 
Between your bearing and your skills, people stop to watch you show off your abilities. You gain an expertise die on Performance checks that utilize your physical prowess, and you have advantage in games of strength such as arm wrestling, shot put, or caber tossing. 
#### IRON STOMACH 
You can eat or drink things that would disgust or disable most people. You have advantage on saving throws made against ingested poisons, and while you can get drunk, you can always will yourself sober again as an action. In addition, so long as you do not critically fail a check made while taking the Hunt and Gather activity, you still find edible Supply as per a success, although on a failure, the result can only be tolerated by you. 
#### TRAILBLAZER 
Your imposing will clears the path for all. You gain an expertise die on Athletics and Engineering checks made to clear a path, brace a structure, or move a heavy object out of the way. 
#### WILD CRAFTER 
You know how to make the wilds serve you. You make Survival checks to harvest materials from fallen creatures at advantage. In addition, you accomplish 1 week’s worth of crafting in 8 hours so long as you are only using materials that you yourself foraged. 
#### WILL OF AGES 
*Prerequisites: 3rd level* 
You have hardened yourself to all but the worst. Once per day, you can spend one use of your rage to ignore a level of fatigue or strife for one hour. Also once per day, you can spend one use of your rage to ignore all levels of fatigue or strife for one minute. If you select this option, you gain a level of fatigue or strife after the duration is up.
