Sometimes two people are simply fated to cross paths again and again. A parent and a child; two lovers; siblings, twins or otherwise; even a hero and their nemesis. The history of the world is changed by the relationship between these two people.

No matter your connection, your story weaves in and out with the other and together, even if your objectives differ, you complete the various required objectives.

- **Player Interest**: Ragnar & Lagertha, Alfred & Uhtred, Móði & Magni   
- **Restrictions:** Must be born in Grimnir, preferably in the [[Lutan]] clan.

#### Source of Inspiration
You draw inspiration from seeing your duty through to the end. You gain inspiration whenever you complete a quest, fulfill a difficult promise, or commit an act of self-sacrifice that includes grievous injury to yourself.  You also gain inspiration everytime you fulfill one of your Heroic Tasks.
_Complete a quest, keep a promise to your own detriment, keep an innocent safe while seriously endangering yourself, commit an act of genuine self-sacrifice._
#### Inspiration Feature
Your aid is a lifeline and a steadying source of resolve. Whenever you take the Help action to aid an ally attacking a creature, you may spend your inspiration. If you do, in addition to the normal benefits of the Help action, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.
#### Feature: Shared Runes ( ᛖ )

You both received the same rune tattoo, the symbol ᛖ. You may have had them tattooed at the same time or one of you added the symbol to the other—not necessarily out of kindness. Regardless these shared symbols have reinforced your bond. At certain moments in the story additional runes will be drawn, adding to your story, your abilities, and your penultimate reason for existing.

#### Feature: The Nature of the Story

When your character is created decide the nature of your bond: Allies, Rivals, or Enemies. Allies and Rivals adventure together, but Rivals tend to compete against, instead of directly support, the other. If your bonded is your Enemy, they are an NPC. This influences many of the abilities you may gain. Based on your decision you have one of the following:

- **Allies.** If you are within 10 feet of your Ally, you gain a +1 bonus to all skill checks and saving throws.
- **Rivals.** If you can see your Rival and your Rival rolls a natural 20, you roll your next d20 with advantage. 
- **Enemies (optional, GM discretion).** While your Enemy can see you, you have advantage on all of your rolls. They gain the same benefit. 

In each case, your ambition is to protect the people of your clan. Ultimately you must undertake tasks that make you become their jarl (even if that’s not your initial intention).

| #### A Lutan Raider<br><br>Your birth clan, if you select this background, is likely the Lutan clan (your GM can adjust this with some reworking of the plot). |

**If a Rival or Ally.** Rivals compete against one another to see who becomes jarl but are willing to work together to overthrow the existing jarl. Allies have agreed to share the position of jarl, once secured An ally or rival may be another PC who also possesses the Bonded Epic Background, or an NPC if no other player chooses it. **If Enemies.** If your bonded has an Enemy they are an NPC and the jarl of the clan you want to rule.

### Suggested Story Connection  

You have joined the expedition to the tower at Kekkell with Hrolf to seek adventure and glory and to secure the resources you need to become your clan’s next jarl.

  

#### Heroic Tasks

  
The Bonded epic background requires more work for the GM to setup because of all the various pair combinations. However, the following provides a framework to build your own story upon.

- A Hero’s Voyage. Obtain a longship and crew. Reward. If Rivals, the bonded that becomes the ship’s captain gains +1 glory. Additionally, if Allies or Rivals, each selects a feat for which they meet the prerequisites.
- Proof of Betrayal. Gather evidence that proves your jarl cheated your family and others.
- Wisdom of Peers. Assemble a council of jarls to review your accusations and pass judgment against your jarl. 
- Trial by Combat. With your evidence secured you may issue a challenge against the other jarl. There may be other ways to secure becoming the jarl as well. Reward. Each bonded selects one item from the following list (they cannot select the same item):
    - dwarven plate
    - oathbow
    - staff of striking
    - sword of sharpness

- Becoming Jarl. Once either you or your Rival or Ally are the jarl, your heroic tasks are complete.

|#### The Enemy<br><br>The Enemy path for this plot requires the GM to do additional planning. They have guidelines on how to do this in the Raiders of the Serpent Sea Campaign Book.|

#### Epic Goal: Atonement

An innocent has been wronged and you must find a way to rectify the injustice. Until you do, your clan never completely follows you. And, if rectified, you stand poised to obtain even greater power over all raiding clans.

**The Jarl’s Right.** As long as your clan still follows you faithfully, once every two weeks you assemble another explorer class longship complete with crew at your clan’s home port. This crew will die for you without question.
