House Rules

In addition to those listed in the link above, rangers may also select the [[Beast Unity]] and [[Viper's Fangs]]  [[1. Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuver]] tradition.

The Explorer's Instinct ability at level 8 now lets you take 2 reactions per round a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus instead of just once.  You can still take no more than 2 reactions in a given round.

The following additional Exploration Knacks are allowed:
### ALL TIED UP 
As an action, you can undo a single knot you made in a cordage while holding it, regardless of the distance. Creatures other than you have disadvantage on skill checks and saving throws made to untie your knots or escape bondage made by you. 
### CLIFFHANGER 
When you start falling, you can use your reaction to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against the DC of whatever effect caused you to fall, or a DC of 10 if there is no obvious DC. On a success, you reach out and grab a ledge that can support your weight (if one is available) and stop falling. If you do not have an open hand to grab the ledge, you can drop an item you are holding as part of this reaction. 
### FIRST AID 
During a short rest, you can give special care to a wounded creature (including yourself) by spending 10 minutes and one use of a healerâ€™s satchel. A creature treated in this way regains 1 additional hit point per hit die it rolls during the short rest. 
### HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN? 
You gain an expertise die on skill checks made to interview people on the whereabouts and recent activity of a creature you are currently tracking. If you have information on your quarry that you can show, such as a wanted poster, the expertise die becomes a d6. 
### NATURAL REMEDIES 
Once between long rests, you can spend an hour collecting ingredients and brew two servings of a herbal drink that is potent for 24 hours. Imbibing a serving suppresses the effects of any ongoing diseases and grants advantage on all saves against diseases for 4 hours. 
### OUTLAND GOURMAND 
Even hardtack looks appetizing when prepared by you. You gain proficiency in cook's utensils, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. Additionally, you gain advantage on checks made to use the Cook journey activity. 
### SMOKE SIGNALS 
You can use a mirror, campfire, or other object that emits light or smoke to communicate over great distances. On a clear day or night, the signal can be seen up to 10 miles away, or only 1 mile during inclement weather. It takes 10 times longer than speaking to convey information in this way, and you may only communicate simple ideas and concepts. Your allies automatically understand the meaning of your signals. Additionally, when you see similar signals from others, you always understand their meaning, regardless as to whether they are your ally or not. 
### STUDIED MEDIATION 
If a creature other than you makes a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check while communicating with one of your studied adversaries, and both of them can see or hear you, you can use your reaction to make the same check. You can replace their roll with your own, potentially changing the outcome.
### SURVIVLALIST
When traveling you may undertake two journey activities instead of one. Both activities must be from the following list: Befriend Animal, Harvest, Hunt and Gather, Scout. (This was originally published as part of the official class and is still found in the PDF and the hardcover book for the Adventurer's Guide, but was removed by errata and is thus not on the tools site anymore; I disagree with this decision and am reversing it.)
