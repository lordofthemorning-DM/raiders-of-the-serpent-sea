The ancient order of seers, the völv, examines the children of the raiding clans in search of individuals with the nascent ability to read the runes and connect with the primal forces of the world. Unfortunately, only a few have sufficient gifts to become seers. The others are sent back to their clans after being trained to compose music, sing songs, collect stories, and watch. Many become bards of the College of the Seers.

This bard is both a storyteller and a manipulator, capable of playing off both sides in a conflict and coming out the winner. Though skilled in the martial arts, they also know how to navigate the complexities of clan politics. And with a touch of the prescient, they can both understand what is to come and influence it.

The latter they do in the form of curses that weigh heavily on the minds of the afflicted, bending them to the skald’s will (or by invoking blessings to benefit allies). Never entirely trusted, even by one’s friends, this bard is always respected.

### Bonus Proficiencies and Specialties
Starting when you swear your oath to the völv to be trained as a Seer at 3rd level, you embark on a lifelong journey, committed to the völv above all. You learn to protect the seers and have enhanced your ability to function as an effective agent for them. You gain proficiency with either martial weapons or medium armor. You gain proficiency with Culture and History. If you are already proficient with either skill, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain additional specialties equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain another specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases. These bonus specialties must be in Culture or History.

### Bestow Fate
At 3rd level, as an action, you mark an individual that you can see or hear within 30 feet and utter a verbal curse against them. You expend one Bardic Inspiration die, assign it to the mark, and then select a fate effect for them. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, they are marked by the selected fate.
- **Clumsy.** You will reduce the first attack roll the mark makes each round by the result of a bardic die roll.
- **Feeble.** You will reduce the first saving throw the mark makes each round by the result of a bardic die roll.
- **Slow.** You will reduce the mark’s movement speed by 5 feet multiplied by the result of a bardic die roll (a target’s movement can never be reduced lower than 5 feet). You will reroll this result at the end of each of the mark’s turns while the effect is active.<br>
After one minute, or if you mark a new target, this effect ends. The effect also ends if you or the target become unconscious. When you use this feature to mark a new target any previous targets are no longer considered marked.

### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Enduring Inspiration
Your curses may be used to empower (or goad) your allies into ever more daring escapades. Starting at 6th level, you can select two new fates for those marked by your Bestow Fate feature. 
- **Bold.** You will increase the first ability check the mark makes each round by the result of a bardic die roll.
- **Sturdy.** You will increase the first saving throw the mark makes each round by the result of a bardic die roll.<br>
In addition, you can now apply Bestow Fate to more than one creature without it ending early so long as no two creatures share the same fate. 

### Potent Fate
Starting at 14th level, if you are unhappy with the result of a Bestow Fate roll, you may reroll it and you must take the second roll. You may only do this once per turn. 

Additionally, you may use your reaction to force a target under the influence of your Bestow Fate to reroll a specific attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (in addition to the current fate effect). You must decide whether they will reroll after they have rolled but before the GM tells you of the result of their roll.
