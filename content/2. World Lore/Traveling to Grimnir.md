Not all who walk the lands of Grimnir arrived during the Exodus from the Lost Lands. In the past, when [[Boða, the Last Yoten|Boða]] briefly wielded the Rainbow Spear, she summoned numerous creatures that have now long made this world their home. 

As well, if rumors are to be believed, the portion of the incomplete spear still embedded on Turnfjall flares to life whenever it desires to drag others to Grimnir.

Some are beasts, to be feared, fought, and slain; others are newcomers. Over the centuries many have arrived, telling a tale of being drawn from their own world in a flash of light only to find themselves alone on a coast of jagged black rock, or stuck waist-deep in a snow dune, or suddenly fighting for their life in the waters of the frigid Serpent Sea. How many countless others have not lived long enough to tell this tale? How many were trapped in some desolate wilderness? Lingering days—or even weeks—until the cold, the hunger, or the jagged teeth of a prowling beast, ended their miserable life? That is a story to worry any soul on a cold winter’s evening.

But of those that survive most become raiders like any other. They couple and have children and over time their origins are forgotten. A story told by their descendants to entertain guests but perhaps not truly believed.
