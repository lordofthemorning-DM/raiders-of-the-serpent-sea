Fanatics are religious zealots in the extreme, berserkers whose rage is not fueled by mere anger or wrath but by zealous devotion.  They are absolutely committed to their faith, and the sight or even thought of those who would defy what they believe in drives them mad with fury.  Terrors to the enemies of the faith, fanatics unleash righteous destruction or unholy slaughter where ever they go.
