The hunter is the ranger at their most basic.  They are masters of woodcraft who employ those skills tracking and hunting down their quarry.  Most cut their teeth on simple prey such as beasts, but many eventually graduate to more dangerous game.  Many have good reputations as monster hunters, eliminating the giants, dragons, and monstrosities that lurk in the wilds, waiting to threaten travelers or menace humanoid settlements, or bounty hunters and guardians tracking down dangerous bandits and raiders.  Others have a darker edge though, being far less particular about who they hunt or why.

### Specialized Hunter
At level 3, you can gain two studied adversaries at the end of a long rest instead of 1.  When you finish a short rest you may swap one for another.  Once you have done so you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Fighting Style
At 3rd level you gain one Fighting Style as per the fighter class.  This fighting style must be Archery, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two Weapon Fighting.

### Bring Down the Quarry
At 7th level you also gain a +1 bonus to damage against your studied adversaries.  This increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 15th level.

### Peerless Tracker
At 11th level you gain a d8 expertise die on the track, scout, or hunt and gather journey activities.  In addition, if tracking one of your studied adversaries the maximum size of expertise die you may gain on the check is 1d12.

### Instinctual Defense
At level 11, your training hunting down dangerous and unique quarry has caused you to develop targeted defenses against their abilities.  Choose one of the following.
#### Evasion
When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
#### Adaptive Defense
You have an expertise die on saving throws to avoid or escape being grappled, restrained, or knocked prone.  In addition, the first time since the start of your turn that you are hit by an attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC against any further attacks from that specific creature until the start of your next turn.
#### Innured Constitution
You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.  This has also bolstered your general constitution, granting an expertise die on all saving throws against disease.

### Master Slayer
At 15th level, when attacking one of your studied adversaries you may increase the benefits of your trained accuracy ability as if you had expended one additional use, to a maximum equivalent of 3 uses.  Once you have done so against a specific creature, you cannot do so again against that creature for 24 hours.
