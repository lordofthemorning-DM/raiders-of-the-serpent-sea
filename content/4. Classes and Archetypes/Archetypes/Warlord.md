Some Marshals command from the rear.  Some command from the front lines, shoulder to shoulder with their comrades in arms.  For the Warlord, not only is the former unthinkable, but the latter is not even enough: they must lead by example.  Focusing more so than most marshals on enhancing their own personal combat prowess, they know that there is no surer way to inspire their troops to fight on all the harder than by watching their leader effortlessly personally cut down the foe.
