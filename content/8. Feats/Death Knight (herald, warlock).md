### Death Knight 
***Prerequisites:** 3 herald and 3 warlock (Deathwalker archetype)* <br>
There are those who walk the line between life and death, bound by oaths that transcend even mortality. These are death knights. Some are blackguards of the foulest sort, those who betrayed their oaths in life and so were damned to eternal unlife as punishment. Others are solemn guardians or avenging revenants, those whose duties are so strong they persist beyond the end of their natural life, earning a reprieve from Death itself, and the power and knowledge to command the grave. You gain the following benefits: 
- You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Strength or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20. 
- If your warlock spellcasting ability is not Charisma, you may change it to Charisma. 
- You divine smite ability deals necrotic damage rather than radiant, as does the Divine Warrior ability if you have it. 
- You may apply a Divine Smite to a successful attack with either Eldritch Scythe or Eldritch Ray in addition to a weapon attack. 
- Your Divine Sense ability always detects undead in addition to the other set creature types you have chosen, and if you choose aberrations and undead then undead have disadvantage on saving throws against your Divine Sense. 
- You gain the Turn Undead cleric feature with the Command Undead Empower Turning ability as an additional Channel Divinity option, except you may not turn undead, only command them. 

### On a Pale Horse 
***Prerequisite:** Death Knight feat* <br>
You have been gained a spectral, undying steed, either as a gift from your patron, or manifested from your own undying will. 
- You know the *find steed* spell as a bonus warlock spell that does not count against your spells known. You may cast it once per short or long rest without expending spell points or a spell slot, and you cast it at 5th level when doing so. Its type may be undead instead of fey, fiend, or celestial, it is resistant to necrotic damage and damage from non-magical weapons, and while riding it you gain resistance to necrotic damage or immunity if you are already resistant. If your steed makes an attack roll, it uses your spell attack bonus in place of its normal attack bonus, and if it hits with an attack while you are mounted on it you may have it deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as normal. Your steed is immune to Turn Undead so long as you are riding it. 
- You may expend points from your Lay on Hands pool up to your proficiency bonus and touch your steed, and when doing so your steed gains temporary hit points equal to the number of points expended x your herald+warlock level. Once you have done so, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 

### Deathly Smite 
***Prerequisite:** On a Pale Horse feat* <br>
When you turn your unflinching gaze upon a foe, you can smite them with the cold implacable grasp of Death itself. You gain the following benefits: 
- You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Strength or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20. 
- When you use Divine Smite, you may expend 2 or more spell points to increase the damage dealt by 1d8 per 2 spell points expended to a maximum of the maximum amount of damage that a Divine Smite would deal for a herald of your herald+warlock level. 
- You may spend 2 spell points to apply an Empowered Smite effect to a Divine Smite, even if you do not have that ability. If you have the Greater Empowered Smite ability, you may also apply one of those effects by spending 2 spell points. 
- You gain access to the following additional empowered smite options: 
- Enervating Smite: The target has their hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage of the smite and must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target also gains 1 level of fatigue or strife, your choice. They may not gain more than 4 levels of either from this ability in one 24 hour period. 
- Vampiric Smite: You regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the smite.
