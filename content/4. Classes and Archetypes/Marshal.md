The following additional Lessons of War are allowed:

### ARTILLERY ENGINEER 
You have spent long hours studying blueprints for siege weaponry and have learned how they work. You gain proficiency in Engineering, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. Additionally, you gain the siegecraft specialty in Engineering.
### CAPTAIN OF THE WATCH 
When you help keep watch during a long rest, you and all other creatures assisting with the watch gain an expertise die on Perception checks until the end of the long rest. 
### DEESCALATION 
Strategically, it’s sometimes best to avoid conflict altogether—if you can. You gain an expertise die when negotiating with hostile creatures that can understand you. If there is a group of hostile creatures, such as a gang of bandits, you automatically succeed on any checks made to tell which of them, if any, is the leader. 
### DRAGOON 
Even if you don’t currently own a mount, you have grown up around horses and other beasts of burden and know how to handle them and keep them calm in almost any situation—even in the heat of battle. You gain proficiency in Animal Handling, or an expertise die if you were already proficient. Any creature that currently serves as a mount or a beast of burden that is in the area of effect for your Commanding Presence has advantage on saving throws made to resist fear.
### MARCHING FIT 
Keeping soldiers’ feet in marching shape starts with the right footwear. You gain proficiency in cobbler’s tools. By spending 1 hour (which may be part of a short or long rest) with cobbler’s tools and a pair of mundane boots or other footwear, you may temporarily modify them to suit one form of difficult terrain, such as slick ice or deep mud. While these boots are worn, the wearer’s movement is not impeded by the difficult terrain selected at the time of construction. This modification lasts for 1 week unless you spend another hour to replace or reinforce the modification, which resets the remaining time. 
### NO ONE LEFT BEHIND 
Soldiers stick together, and no one knows that better than you. While carrying a willing creature of size Medium or smaller, you may treat their weight as halved for a number of hours equal to your Strength modifier between the ends of each long rest, provided you are not currently encumbered or carrying more than one bulky item on your person. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on checks and saving throws made to free your allies from grapples and restraints caused by non-creatures (such as manacles or the entangle spell). 
### STUDENT OF HISTORY 
You know that the art of military strategy starts by learning from those who came before you. You gain an expertise die to checks made to recall knowledge related to great battles, famous generals, or legendary warriors. On a critical success, you gain one additional piece of useful information about the subject. 
### TACTICAL FORGERY 
You leverage the art of misdirection and miscommunication to befuddle your enemies. You gain proficiency in a forgery kit, or an expertise die if you were already proficient. You may use your forgery kit to create false letters, missives, or other misleading communications, and you can always find a way to have such documents intercepted or observed by your foes.
