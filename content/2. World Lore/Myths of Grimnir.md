### A Wild World
Once there was a world, another world, that we call the Lost Lands. All know the story of [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], and his folly. His vanity, deviousness, and longing for power doomed the Lost Lands. [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], brought about the end. Yet [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]], in her infinitely growing wisdom, understood how he might also become a beginning. 

As she conjured the magnificent rainbow portal, she pierced [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], again and again. Blood sprayed, covering her, the spear, and ultimately spilling into the void. That blood was transmogrified by the power of the portal, and it proliferated. There, on the other side, it simmered and bubbled, a vast sea of crimson. Her next strokes were precise, bits of flesh that twisted, coiled, and grew, wrapping around, twisting against, that sea of blood. The two—flesh and blood; land and sea—fought the first wars between them, struggling to find a balance. The largest chunk of flesh became the Inner Lands, smaller bits the other continents, and the smallest flesh pieces became the uncountable islands of the Serpent Sea.

And yet, despite these gruesome wounds, [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], still lived. His life light dimming in his eyes, she struck him again and again. His leg and arm bones became the great mountain range Turnfjall. Other bones became smaller mountain ranges and his shattered teeth the numerous boulders dotting Grimnir. Her death stroke parted his head from his shoulders and all his body was cast through, torn and shredded, and repurposed to become a living land to shelter those he had failed.

Only his head did [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] leave behind. For nothing could be gained, she reckoned, from bringing his cunning into this new world.

### Aldyhn, First of the Völv
Though she had technically created the world, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] found it a strange place. The air she inhaled tasted of her uncle’s breath and the touching of a tree or stone reminded her of when [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]], used to rest his hand on her shoulder, offering comfort to a niece he once loved. [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] seemed a part of this new world and, at night, she suffered, plagued by dreams, by torments.

After the early colonies were established, [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] took her son [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]], still not quite a man himself, and the two boarded a small boat called a faering. Her intention was to map some part of the world to better understand it. Maybe even to convince herself that it was not more than just her uncle’s body living on after his death.

Regardless, she and [[Thonir, the Almost God|Thonir]] had several adventures as they sailed and rowed their way across the Serpent Sea and up many of the rivers feeding into it or siphoning from it. One such was when they discovered a passage into the mountains of Turnfjall and found a new home for the surviving Vanir. But that is not this story.

Instead, on a cloudy day they headed east, but kept the coasts of the many scattered northern islands always in view. An island, no more remarkable than any other, nonetheless caught her attention and she drifted nearer it, ultimately landing to make camp for the night. Though spring was several weeks underway there was still snow covering the ground. Her campfire made short work of it (and the chill air) and underneath their sleeping furs, inside their hide tent, they slept.

Yet [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] woke to a moonless night sky, the stars crisp and twinkling above her.

“[[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]],” her uncle's whisper traveled across the wind, startling her. His voice seemed to come from the north, and she chased after it. She was after all [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] of the Vanir; what else would she do in such a situation?

She found a trail into the hills and, at its end, a grove and a pool of water that was warm to her touch. Steam rose from it, forming land clouds that made it hard to see, made it hard for the outer world to intrude on the inner. She sat near the pool and her uncle’s whispers drifted away. She stared into the waters.

But she did not understand. She did not see. Hours passed and she never even worried about Thonir, her son asleep and alone in the wild. She did not think of the Lost Lands, not of her dead husband, or the many friends she had lost. She thought of nothing other than that she knew she was not really seeing.

The blindness frustrated her such that she drove her dagger into her own face and carved out her eye. She gave it as an offering to the old gods that the Vanir were already beginning to forget. And when she did, she finally saw. Later, she would talk of it often, never the details, but the change. Losing her eye gave her a view of the past, the present, and the future.

[[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] would revisit the island regularly over the years and eventually built a temple there. A temple that to this day is still inhabited by the völv, the order of seers of which [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]] was the first.


> _I woke in the midst of night to see a one-eyed stranger standing over me. Colored lightning flashed in the sky, and she seemed of another world. And yet. She was my mother, Aldyhn. But not quite. Not quite ever the same. I vowed never to return to that island, never to visit that cursed Well of Wisdom._
