House Rules

In addition to those listed in the link above, rogues may also select the [[Viper's Fangs]] [[combat maneuvers|combat maneuver]] tradition.

The following additional Skill Tricks are allowed:
### BODY DOUBLE 
*Prerequisite: 13th level, d8 expertise die on checks with disguise kit* 
Your expertise die on checks using a disguise kit increases to 1d10. In addition, you have a special inexperienced follower called a Body Double who looks identical to you and who can attend public gatherings in your stead, providing you a valuable alibi and acting as a decoy. If your Body Double dies, you can hire a new one for 500 gold, though you may only have one Body Double at a time. This follower does not count against your normal limit. 
### COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY 
*Prerequisite: 13th level, d8 expertise die on checks with a forgery kit* 
Your expertise die in checks using a forgery kit increases to 1d10. In addition, you have mastered the dastardly art of coin clipping and counterfeiting banknotes and bonds. You may maintain a rich lifestyle without paying for it, and you earn double the amount of gold when performing the Illegal Work downtime activity when making checks using a forgery kit. When performing this downtime activity, you may choose to attempt work of a Nearly Impossible difficulty, which requires a DC 30 check, affords a rich lifestyle, and rewards 10d6 x 3 gold (before doubling). If you are not caught during this downtime activity, you are assumed to have successfully exchanged your false funds for genuine money. 
### DICE CONTROL 
You gain an expertise die in Sleight of Hand checks and checks with any gaming set. In addition, you gain advantage on Sleight of Hand checks when cheating at gambling and other games. 
### FAKE ID 
You gain proficiency with checks using a forgery kit. If you are already prficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you have numerous false pieces of identification (a mix of real and fictional identities). You can present your fake identification to make a prestige check (using your normal prestige rating) to convince someone you are one of these fake identities in order to gain an audience or call in a favor. You may add your expertise die (if any) on checks using forgery kits to this roll. Anyone who is suspicious of your identification can attempt to detect the forgery by making an Investigation check with a DC equal to your passive check using a forgery kit.
### LEGERDEMAIN 
*Prerequisites: 13th level, d8 expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks* 
Your expertise die in Sleight of Hand checks increases to 1d10. In addition, you gain a magician’s kit that has 10 charges (weighs 3 lbs. and costs 25 gp to fully restock, which can be done wherever you can purchase a component pouch or otherwise gather spell components), which you can use to fake the casting of up to 5th-level evocation spells with instantaneous effects and conjuration spells where you can provide what is being summoned (e.g. faking find familiar to pull a rabbit out of a hat). To fake the casting of a spell you can use an action to make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC equal to 20 + twice the spell’s level and expend a number of charges from your magician’s kit equal to the spell’s level (cantrips use no charges). People who disbelieve you can make an Arcana or Religion check opposed by your original roll. The faked spell has no effect beyond looking and sounding like the real spell. At the Narrator’s discretion, you can attempt higher level spells or spells from other schools of magic, but they may require additional preparation and/or costs to pull off. 
### LIVING STATUE 
You gain an expertise die on checks using a disguise kit. In addition, you are skilled at blending in with your surroundings and can apply the camouflaged property to any disguise you make. 
### POISON PEN 
You gain proficiency with checks using a forgery kit. If you are already proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you can spend a week engaging in a campaign to discredit an enemy using forged letters and other made-up evidence of misdeeds. Make an Intelligence check with a forgery kit with a DC equal your enemy’s passive Prestige check. If you succeed, they are afflicted with a random short term mental-stress effect and their prestige is reduced by the amount you beat their DC by for the purposes of retaining followers and calling in favors for 1d6 days or until they take active steps to clean up their reputation (at the Narrator’s discretion, the negative effects could be more long lasting). On a failure (or a successful opposed Investigation roll by an interested party), your deceit is known to your target and the general public. 
### TAVERN TRIVIA 
Whenever you make an Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check, you add half your proficiency bonus if you are not already proficient with the skill. This bonus does not stack with the Bard ability Jack of All Trades or other, similar features.
