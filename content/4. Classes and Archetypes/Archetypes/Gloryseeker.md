Gloryseekers are those heralds dedicated to achieving personal fame and glory.  Some are questing knights errant riding out to slay dragons, fight blackguards on bridges, or rendezvous with green giants.  Others are doomed godsworn warriors heartily throwing themselves into danger that in glorious death in battle they might achieve their preferred afterlife.  Still others are those born to glory, descendants of gods waging war, slaying monsters, and becoming kings.  And some are simply vain, power hungry narcissists seeking to “cheat” death by achieving immortality through memory.

All gloryseekers follow similar tenets.
- **Death or Glory.**  You must be willing to put everything on the line.  A death in glory is better than a life in shame.
- **My Name will Live On.**  You must craft a legacy for yourself, not only performing great deeds but ensuring those deeds are known, and your fame will outlive you.
- **Beneath You.**  Do not sully yourself with mundane and ordinary tasks, except where absolutely necessary.
- **Eternal Drive.**  Never be satisfied, and do not rest on your laurels.  Always strive to better yourself and seek out new accomplishments.
