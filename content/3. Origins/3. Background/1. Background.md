Backgrounds function similarly to standard 5e, giving recommended starting equipment, languages, skill and tool proficiencies, and a minor feature.  Unlike standard 5e, A5e back grounds also give a min or advancement feature if you meet certain requirements, and are also the source of ability score bonuses gained at level 1, with each background giving +1 to a specific score and +1 to a score of your choice.
