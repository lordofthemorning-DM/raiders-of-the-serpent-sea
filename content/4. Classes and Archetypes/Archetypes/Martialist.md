K nights of long-dead magical orders, tacticians specialized in arcane warfare, wielders of ancient weapon-spirits, and students of entities whose battles echo throughout the multiverse. Martialists tap into sources of power that mix magic and combat skill. They may be glorious heroes, brutal villains, pragmatic mercenaries, or even solitary hermits practicing their studies in seclusion. Many war-minded fey, fiends, and celestials traffic with warlocks who become martialists. It has also come to pass that some people forge pacts by coming in contact with certain artifacts such as sentient magic weapons. (The artifacts might even be the patron themselves!)

### Eldritch Armament 
When you take this archetype at 1st level, your study of eldritch warfare infuses your magical practice. You gain proficiency with four martial weapons of your choice, the History skill, and the History skill specialty military history. Finally, choose one of the following options, either Warrior’s Curse or Combat Maneuvers: 
#### Warrior’s Curse 
You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects: 
Choose magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you apply the curse. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level. 
You gain a pool of defensive dice, which begins empty. Every time the cursed creature hits you with an attack, you gain a defensive die. You may spend one of your defensive dice as a reaction when you are hit with an attack, adding 1d4 to your AC against that attack and potentially turning the hit into a miss. You may not spend a defensive die on the attack that you acquired it from. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest. 
Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
#### Combat Maneuvers 
You learn to use  [[1. Combat Maneuvers]]. You gain proficiency with the [[Cutting Omen]] and your choice of the [[Arcane Knight]], [[Eldritch Blackguard]], [[Sanctified Steel]], or Tempered Iron traditions. You learn one maneuver of your choice from traditions you are proficient with. 
You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of Table: Martialist Maneuvers (below) shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level. 
Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same level from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Battlefield Maestro 
At 6th level, you gain supernatural influence over the flow of combat. As a reaction when you see a creature within 30 feet make an attack roll (including yourself), you can choose to grant advantage or impose disadvantage. After using this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. 

### Warrior’s Resolve 
At 10th level, your time in the thick of combat has hardened your psyche. You gain immunity to the frightened condition, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed or compelled. In addition, during a short rest or upon the completion of a long rest you may spend a hit die to remove one level of fatigue or strife. You may only spend one die this way per rest. 

### Eldritch Armor 
At 14th level, you learn to shape your Eldritch Blast into a protective field around yourself, known as Eldritch Armor. You can use your action and forego your movement this turn to gain temporary hit points equal to 3d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The temporary hit points persist until depleted or until you drop the field (no action required), fall unconscious, or die. While you have temporary hit points from your Eldritch Armor, a creature that damages you takes 3d4 force damage. When you reach 17th level, your temporary hit points increase to 4d10 + your spellcasting modifier and the damage done to creatures that damage you increases to 4d4. 
You cannot use your Eldritch Blast while this field is active. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
