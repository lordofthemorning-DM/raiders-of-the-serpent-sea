House Rules

At level 13, you gain Death Blow as a bonus combat maneuver known that does not count against your number of maneuvers known, even though they do not meet the prerequisites. 

In addition starting at level 17 as part of the First Blood ability you may use Death Blow  on a surprised creature in the first round of combat for free without expending exertion. You may only do so once per combat.
