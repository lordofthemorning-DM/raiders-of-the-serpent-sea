With their connections to the gods of the Stone Court, clerics are important contributors to raiding life. Discovery Priests concern themselves with sailing, exploring, and seizing the riches to be found. These clerics often serve as raid captains or navigators and within each clan they are honored, respected, and at times, feared. 

You have a favored god but respect them all and your divine power comes from the entirety of the Stone Court.

### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and navigator’s tools. You also gain proficiency with vehicle (land) or vehicle (water).

### Eye of the Navigator
Starting at 1st level, when you are traveling through any environment other than urban or dungeon, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) or Wisdom (Perception) checks you make. Additionally, your experience at sea—and the blessing of your god—gives you a swim speed equal to your walking speed and you are able to hold your breath twice as long as normal.  

### Channel Divinity: Guided by the Divine
Your years of exploration, combined with the bond you share with your god, grant you exceptional abilities to locate areas of interest. Starting at 2nd level, you may use an action to use your Channel Divinity to help locate a destination. Until your next long rest, you know the following information about any known location:
- How far it is to your chosen destination in hours, days, or weeks.
- The compass direction you need to take to reach your destination.<br>
You cannot determine the distance to a location that you have only heard of by story or myth, but you can determine the direction. If the location is not known by any mortal, the location is not on the same plane of existence, or is magically hidden, you learn neither direction nor distance, but this ability will confirm whether the destination actually exists.

You may only use this ability to focus on one location at a time—the most recent use of this feature overrides any previous uses.

### Channel Divinity: Wrathful Flood
Starting at 6th level, as an action you can use Channel Divinity to create a damaging wave of water that rapidly moves away from you. The wave may be up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet wide and originates from a point within 60 feet of you that you can see.

Any creature caught in this area must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. If they fail, they take 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, are knocked prone and restrained until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone or restrained. If this feature is used within 10 feet of any body of water, you may change the damage type to cold.

### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once, on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 acid, cold, or lightning damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Surveyor of the Depths
Starting at 17th level, you can now breathe underwater, and your swim speed is doubled. Furthermore, your Wrathful Flood feature is enhanced. The wall persists and at the start of each of your turns it moves 10 feet away from you, carrying any creature that failed the previous round’s saving throw with it. Any creature that enters (or starts their turn in) the wall must make the Strength saving throw or suffer the Wrathful Flood effects, except that the damage amount is changed.
- First Round. 21 (6d6) damage.
- Second Round. 10 (3d6) damage.
- Third round. 3 (1d6) damage and the wall disappears.
