They also gain access to the following alternate paragon gifts as options alongside *relentless endurance:*

*Mighty Thews*- The short and long ranges for ranged attacks you make with thrown weapons, slings, or composite bows are increased by 10 and 20 ft respectively. If you possess the Mighty Attacks trait, you may apply it to critical hits with these weapons and any bonus damage die from Mighty Attacks automatically rolls the maximum. If you do not have the Mighty Attacks trait, you instead gain that trait (but not the additional benefits to it from this gift).

*Ancestral Guidance*- You may cast the *commune* spell once per long rest.
