Your family once ruled a wealthy Baendur kingdom, and your mother was a respected and remarkable queen. One winter’s day, raiders invaded your lands. When your parents rode out to oust them from your lands, your family was defeated. You, the youngest of all your siblings, were taken prisoner and forced to watch your brothers and sisters be slaughtered.

Since then, you have lived with the raiders and have come to accept them as your own people. They eventually adopted you and you are no longer a thrall. Yet you have never forgotten your family or the lands that by birth are yours to inherit. Recently your adopted family died during a raid between rival clans. You survived but the location of your homeland was lost with the deaths of your raider family. 

Yet you returned to life the very next day. Since then, you have died several more times, but you always rise again, the following morning. Now you seek a way to end the curse so that you might die as a raider should and earn your place in the Halls of the Slain.

#### Source of Inspiration
You draw inspiration from taking charge and directing what needs to be done. You gain inspiration whenever you lead by example or convince a group of NPCs to act against their own interests in order to complete a difficult task.  You also gain inspiration whenever you fulfill one of your Heroic Tasks.
_Settle a vitriolic argument, direct a large number of nonplayer characters to participate in the completion of a task, rally a multitude of people to a cause._

#### Inspiration Feature
With a level head and measured logic, you objectively determine the best path forward. You may spend your inspiration and a minute’s deliberation to determine the results of an upcoming plan of action (as the _augury_ spell).
#### Feature: Fate’s Orphan ( ᛊ )

You received a fate tattoo (ᛊ) upon becoming adopted into a raiding clan. This rune symbolizes the sun and the growth it brings the world, as well as indicating certain success for the rune wearer’s ambitions. Later in the story other runes will be drawn, adding to your story and your abilities.

#### Feature: True Survivor

You thrive under adversity. Whenever an ally reaches 0 hit points (whether they die or recover), give yourself inspiration. Unlike other characters you may accumulate more than one inspiration, up to a limit equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Suggested Characteristics

The royal heir has always lived in two worlds—the dead family they feel loyalty and kinship with, as well as the raider family that raised them. They also feel guilty because they care for their adopted family, and this may come across to others as aloofness or surliness. Others are often drawn to the heir, despite this.

### Starting Story Connection

After your raider family perished, you served as a guard for the völv and have recently joined Hrolf’s expedition to Kekkell to earn glory and respect. You think with the plunder to be found in the south that you may soon own your own longship.

#### Heroic Tasks

- **A Raider’s Revenge.** The murder of your adoptive family cannot be left unatoned for. You must seek out and slay the raiders responsible for their deaths. Reward. You gain 1 bonus glory point. You may also select a feat for which you meet the prerequisites.
- **Find Homeland.** You only have a dim memory of the location of your kingdom—it is in the west. Beyond that you are not sure, though you remember vineyards and gentle mountains and a more temperate climate than what you have experienced since then. Reward. Reaching the kingdom’s location will put you in touch with former allies of your family, which will unlock new connections. You may also be able to recover a lost family heirloom. Choose one of:  
    - A helm of awe once worn by your mother.
    - A very rare or lower rarity ioun stone of your choice.

- **Return to Glory.** Once you have recovered the location of your homeland, it is your duty to return there and re-establish rulership, in the name of your mother and father. Reward. You gain 1 glory point.

#### Epic Goal: Unify the Kingdoms

Long have the Baendur been disjointed. Begin uniting the scattered kingdoms into a single empire.

**Gift of Glory.** You gain 3 glory points. As long as your glory is 15 or higher, you automatically succeed in any Persuasion or Intimidation check with the Baendur and have advantage on such checks with all others.
