Many marshals lead from the front, but frontliners refuse to be seen anywhere else. Specialized in leading small groups of close-knit individuals, they are tough, gritty, and bring out the best in those fighting alongside them. Because of this, frontliners are usually popular with enlisted troops, who see the frontliner as “one of them.” 

### Toughness and Grit 
At 3rd level, you learn the techniques of front-line soldiers and earn the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them. You gain proficiency with the Adamant Mountain combat tradition. Your maximum hit points increase by 3, and at each additional level of Marshal, your maximum hit points increase by 1. 

### Rub Some Dirt On It 
At 7th level, you may use your Rallying Surge feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus between rests. 

### Withstand and Endure 
At 11th level, your toughness is legendary. You gain proficiency with Constitution saving throws. Whenever you succeed on a Constitution saving throw, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier. 

### Fearless Charge 
Also at 11th level, friendly creatures in the range of your Commanding Presence can ignore the frightened condition for the purposes of determining where it can move. 

### Stay With Us 
At 15th level, you can use Spur Ally to grant an unconscious ally advantage on a death save. 

### Hero to the Troops 
At 18th level, the mere sight of you fighting is enough to spur allies on. An allied creature inside the range of your Commanding Presence who can see you engaged in combat may spend a bonus action to immediately end one of the following conditions on themself: confused, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, or rattled. You may also use your Rallying Surge feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus between rests, and your Spur Ally feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus between rests.
