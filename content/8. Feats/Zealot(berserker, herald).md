### Zealot 
***Prerequisite:** 3 herald and 3 berserker (fanatic archetype)* <br>
There are those whose righteous (or unholy) anger burns with a fervor beyond the pale of most peopleâ€™s understanding, even the faithful. Utterly dedicated and burning with a wrath against the enemies of their faith, these zealots use their oath to channel their fury towards very specific ends. Not a mad dog, but a focused hunter. You gain the following benefits: 
- You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Strength or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20. 
- If your fanatic damage type is radiant, you gain your choice of the Lawful or Good alignment traits. If it is necrotic, you instead gain your choice of the Evil or Chaotic alignment traits. Once chosen your alignment trait cannot be changed, but you can gain a second alignment trait that is not opposed. 
- You gain proficiency with the Zealous Stance combat maneuver and do not have to spend exertion to activate it. Furthermore, you gain the following additional benefits while Zealous Stance is active: 
- Half your berserker levels count as herald levels for the purpose of the damage dealt by your divine smite ability. 
- Half your herald levels count as berserker levels for the purpose of the Crushing Blows ability. 
- You may cast herald spells with a range of self or touch while raging, and may concentrate on the following spells while raging: bless, calculated retribution, heroism, protection from evil and good, and shield of faith. <br>

### Divine Avenger 
***Prerequisite:** Zealot feat* <br>
You channel your zeal into your most devastating blows to bring divine judgment to the enemies of your faith, avenge those under its protection, and defend yourself from those who would defy you. You gain the following additional special Furious Critical options: 
- Raging Divinity- Immediately after resolving the triggering attack, you may cast one of the following spells: cure wounds targeting yourself, lesser restoration targeting yourself, dispel magic targeting yourself or the creature struck, or command targeting the creature struck (if upcast you may target other creatures as well as long as one of the targets is the creature struck). No additional action is required, but you must expend a spell slot and have the chosen spell prepared as normal. You may cast the listed spells as part of this ability even when raging. 
- Divine Wrath- The target of the attack gains one level of strife. Creatures with an opposite alignment from yours or that worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment suffer two levels of strife instead. A creature may not gain more than four levels of strife from this ability in one 24 hour period. 

### Smiter of the Unrighteous 
***Prerequisite:** Divine Avenger feat* <br>
You channel all of your divinely inspired wrath into your blows to smite any who would dare stand against you. You gain the following benefits: 
- You may spend 1 exertion point to apply an Empowered Smite effect to a Divine Smite, even if you do not have that ability. If you have the Greater Empowered Smite ability, you may apply one of those effects by spending 2 exertion points instead. 
- While raging, you gain the Aura of Smiting Improved Sacred Aura option, even if you do not have the Sacred Aura or Improved Sacred Aura abilities. If you do have the Improved Sacred Aura ability and chose a different option, both auras are active while raging, and if you chose Aura of Smiting as your Improved Sacred Aura option then while raging affected creatures other than you increase their critical hit range with weapons by 1 to a maximum of 17-20. For the purpose of Aura of Smiting, your effective herald level is your herald+berserker level.
