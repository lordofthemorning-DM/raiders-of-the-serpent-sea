So-called steel blooded sorcerers are supernaturally infused with martial magical knowledge. They are creatures of the front lines, despite their sorcerous constitution. Rather than training, steel blooded sorcerers discover that skill with weapons, armor, and magic are all inherent to their very nature. Onlookers marvel at their prodigious talent, yet few know the secret of its origin.

### Combat Maneuvers 
Also beginning at level 1, you learn to use [[1. Combat Maneuvers]]. You gain proficiency with the [[Cutting Omen]] tradition and one more chosen from [[Arcane Knight]], [[Eldritch Blackguard]], Rapid Current, Mirror’s Glint, or Mist and Shade. You learn one maneuver of your choice from traditions you are proficient with. You have an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of Table: Steel Blooded Maneuvers (below) shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level. Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same level from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Innate Warrior 
At first level, you have an innate knowledge of the tools of warfare. You gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, simple weapons, martial weapons, and shields. 

### Extra Attack 
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Combat Caster 
At 14th level, you gain the following metamagic options: 
- Striking Spell. When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you may spend 2 sorcery points to cast a spell with a range of touch and a casting time of 1 Action on the target you just struck. 
- Resilient Spell. When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you may spend 2 sorcery points to grant yourself advantage on the first concentration check to maintain concentration on it.

### Sorcerous Maneuvers 
Also at 14th level, you may spend sorcery points instead of exertion points to fuel your combat maneuvers. 

### Sorcerous Protection 
Beginning at level 18, you learn the most impressive steel blooded metamagic of all, shaping your spells into a protective carapace that, when broken, bolsters you or punishes your enemies: Armoring Spell. When you cast a spell, you may spend 4 sorcery points to make it an armoring spell. The casting of the spell is suspended part-way through, and you gain temporary hit points equal to double the spell’s level. When the last of these hit points are lost, the casting of the spell completes (requiring no further action). It is at this point you determine the targets of the spell, if any. Unless it is impossible, the spell must include either you or the source of the triggering damage among its targets or area of effect. You may choose to exclude yourself from a spell with an area, if desired.
