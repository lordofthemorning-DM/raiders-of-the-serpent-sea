> _"I’ve seen more than one raider draw his last breath, dying on my tavern’s floorboard after attacking another for calling them a tusser’s bastard, or tuss, as my more concise patrons might say. The implication being that somehow, someway, they have the blood of the Yoten flowing through them. A laughable insult, such is, for living where I do, for as long as I have, I’d know if creatures such as these walked among us. They don’t exist. Our ancestors left all that behind them when they came here, to Grimnir. I am sure of it."_

Tuss do in fact exist. Their mothers are always human and when they are born the tuss are indistinguishable from other babies. The only difference that becomes apparent as they age is that they are generally stronger, healthier, and more successful than their cohorts. Many tuss even live their entire lives without ever realizing how different they are. Others are not so lucky.

It might happen in a fight or a harsh argument. Their eyes flash purple. They land a blow too hard. The blood flowing in their veins transforms them, providing a glimpse into their ancestry. As quickly as it comes this transformation ends.

Often the event goes without any remark from friends or family. They ignore it, pretend it never happened. They don’t want it to have happened. But sometimes the event cannot be pretended away and the tuss must be dealt with. They may be ushered out of their community by cover of night—exiled. Other times they are killed. This is done simply because the tuss is feared to be a Yoten.

All of this is done to protect their families. For if knowledge of the tuss ever becomes widely known anyone close to them is at risk. 

### Secret Birthright

When a tuss comes of age a drive kindles in them. They become obsessed with bettering themselves—some do it by mastering their abilities on the battlefield while others seek out knowledge, desiring to learn all that they can. But most lack an understanding of their true nature… and many do not even try to understand why they are so different. Because they fear any answers they might find.

### Capable and Remarkable

The tuss love their communities and learn to do all they can to better them. Others come to rely upon the tuss so they often become raid leaders, even jarls. The future is bright for a raider tuss—as long as they never reveal their true ancestry.

### Tuss Names

Tuss have the same names as others in their community.

### Tuss Traits

Tuss have the following traits.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.
- **Age.** Tuss age the same as humans. 
- **Size.** You are Medium.
- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Steadfast.** As long as you have not taken lightning damage since your last turn, if you are reduced to zero hit points, or as a bonus action on your turn, you may spend one Hit Die to regain hit points. Roll your die and add your Constitution modifier. You are healed by this amount. You are unable to use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
- **Intrepid.** Your survival instinct is remarkably strong. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to gain an expertise die on that roll. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Tuss may select one of the heritage gifts of a Human: *Diehard Survivor*, *Ingenious Focus*, or *Spirited Traveler*.  See the following link for details: https://a5e.tools/rules/human

At 10th level, you may also choose following paragon gift.

*True Nature*- As an action, you manifest your true nature. Your physical appearance changes noticeably. Your skin or eyes may shift to an unusual color. You might sprout horns or suddenly become covered with fur or scales. Define these appearance details when you select this heritage. You may use an action to hide your true nature once more.  You also automatically activate your true form as part of your Steadfast ability when reduced to 0 hit points. While your true nature ability is active you have one of the following sets of additional abilities (chosen when you gain this gift):
*Form of War*
- **Darkvision.** You see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light (colors in this darkness are seen as shades of gray).
- **Powerful.** Whenever you hit with a weapon attack you do additional damage, equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up).
- **Swift.** Your walking speed increases by 5.
- **Unsettling.** You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
*Form of Sorcery*
- **Darkvision.** You see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light (colors in this darkness are seen as shades of gray).
- **Unsettling.** You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
- **Alien Mind.** You have an Expertise die on concentration checks.
- **Powerful Magic.** You may add the damage equal to your proficiency bonus to damage with one spell.
*Form of Monsters*
- **Darkvision.** You see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light (colors in this darkness are seen as shades of gray).
- **Unsettling.** You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
- **Fear of Monsters.** When you assume your true form, any non-yoten creature that can see you must make a wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier or be frightened of you for one minute.  A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.  Once a creature saves against this effect or it ends for them they are immune to it for 24 hours.  Creatures who have sworn an oath of fellowship with you do not have to make this save except for the first time they ever see your true form.
- **Prey on the Fearful.** When you hit a creature with an attack or deal damage to it with a spell, you may add your proficiency bonus to one damage roll for that spell or attack if the creature is currently frightened of you.
