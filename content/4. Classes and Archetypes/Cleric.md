Allowed Archetypes for this campaign:  [[Discovery Priest]], [[Hecatomb]], [[Master of Mead]], [[Necropomp]], [[Trickster Priest]], [[Warpriest]]

The following additional Signs of Faith are allowed:
#### ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL 
*Prerequisites: cannot have the Severity principle of devotion* <br>
You have an affinity for animals and they tend to trust you. You can always use Wisdom for Animal Handling checks and if a creature of the Beast type would normally be indifferent to you, it is friendly instead. This has no effect on creatures that would normally be hostile, even if you have a similar feature or benefit that would make a hostile creature indifferent. 
#### BLESSING OF WAR 
Your faith has a martial aspect and you can bless the weapons of the faithful. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a weapon and bless it. Until the start of your next long rest, the first time the weapon blessed this way would break, it does not break and loses the blessing instead. If the wielder of the weapon has an exertion pool and it is empty, they can also dismiss the blessing as a bonus action to recover 1 point of exertion. 
#### CANTOR 
You have been trained as a religious musician and can inspire the faithful with your songs. You gain proficiency with the Performance skill and a musical instrument of your choice. You can always use Wisdom when making Performance checks or checks with musical instruments you are proficient with. 
#### CONFESSOR 
People tend to trust you and want to open up to you, even without prompting. At the Narrator’s discretion, characters you talk to will often volunteer details about their lives and their struggles. You have an expertise die on Insight checks and gain the Insight skill specialty of reading emotions. In addition, when taking the Gather Information downtime activity of the Gossip journey activity, you can choose to roll Insight instead of Investigation or Persuasion for the check. 
#### ECCLESIAL SPEECH 
Your faith has a stronger than normal focus on language as a component of its religious training. You learn two languages from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and Primordial. In addition, you learn Ecclesial Speech, which is a secret language known only to other members of your faith or order with its own spoken, written, and signed forms.
#### KEEPER OF SACRED MYSTERIES 
Your religious training or practice includes producing beautiful calligraphy and illuminations of sacred texts, but also the heavy responsibility of hiding the secrets of your faith in those same texts. You gain proficiency with calligrapher’s tools. In addition, when writing religious texts you can encode hidden meanings or messages into the text. The apparent text (which usually contains more standard religious instruction and wisdom) must be at least four times longer than the hidden message. Other creatures who are strongly affiliated with your faith such as other clerics of the same tradition or the supernatural servants of your higher power can find and read the message automatically with no check required, and you can do the same with similarly hidden wisdom or messages from them. Creatures from outside your faith or tradition can spend a minute to make a Religion check against your spell save DC to detect the presence of a hidden message, and are able to read the hidden message if they succeed by 5 or more. 
#### MESSAGE IN DREAMS 
*Prerequisites: 9th level*<br>
You can come to others in dreams, conveying the word of your faith. You always have the dream spell prepared, and it is considered a cleric spell for you. You can cast it as part of taking a long rest without using material components or a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, you must be the messenger and cannot terrorize the target. 
#### MONASTIC FOODSTUFFS 
You come from a religious order that creates some kind of foodstuff as part of monastic practice. Common variations on this theme are bread, cheese, beer, and wine, but it can be almost anything. You gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies and cook’s tools. In addition, your order has carefully created and maintained a small collection of secret recipes. Trade goods you produce with cook’s tools or brewer’s supplies have double their usual value. Finally, your culinary knowledge is refined enough that you can identify spices and other foodstuffs by appearance and smell and can tell cheap or fake imitations from the genuine article without the need for an ability check.
