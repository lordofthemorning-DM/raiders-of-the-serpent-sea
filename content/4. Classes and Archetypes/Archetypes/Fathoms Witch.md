Fathoms witches are those who see magic as an ever flowing current, a river of power and knowledge and secrets that ever runs around and through all things, ebbing and flowing like the tide, and with depths beyond the fathoming of mortals. They are at home amidst the seas, able to shape their bodies to better be at home in the waters, and like the waters of the world excel at the duality of creation and destruction, giving and taking life. 

### Anointed by the Sea 
When you take this archetype at 2nd level you add all spells of the water school to your list of witch spells. You may also cast the alter self spell at will without expending a spell slot even if it isn't prepared, but only choosing the Amphibious option when doing so, and you may turn the benefits on and off for the duration as an action instead of being able to choose a different one. When you do so, the same benefits apply to your familiar. 

### Water's Balm 
At 6th level whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points, you may add your spellcasting ability modifier to one healing roll for that spell. 

### Embrace of the Deeps 
At 10th level you gain resistance to your choice of lightning, cold, or acid damage, and can change which type whenever you finish a short or long rest. In addition, whenever you finish a long rest you are surrounded by a thin shield of water that absorbs incoming damage, granting you temporary hit points equal to your witch level + your spellcasting ability modifier. Finally, when you cast the free Amphibious alter self spell granted by Anointed by the Waves, it no longer requires concentration. 

### Tempest's Fury 
At 14th level, you add the *lightning bolt* spell to your witch spell list. You always have the *geyser blast*, *scalding steam*, *lightning bolt*, and *steal breath* spells prepared, they do not count against your number of witch spells prepared, and you may cast each of these once per long rest at the lowest spell level without expending a spell slot.

*Geyser blast*, *scalding steam*, and *steal breath* were all originally published in Spells from the Forgotten Vault and have been recreated here.

Geyserblast 
*3rd-level (evocation; nature, water)* 
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard 
**Casting Time:** 1 action 
**Range:** Self 
**Area:** 60 feet 
**Area shape:** Line 
**Components:** V, S, M (a small metal valve or nozzle) 
**Duration:** Instantaneous 
**Saving Throw:** Strength halves 
A high-pressure stream of water blasts forth from your outstretched hand. Creatures must make a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage, be pushed 20 feet away from you and knocked prone. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and is not pushed or knocked prone. 
In addition, the water douses any unattended flames and scours any clinging substances such as slime, oil, or contact poisons from the surface of every creature in the stream. 
*Cast at Higher Levels.* The damage increases by 1d6 for every spell slot level above 3rd. The push distance increases by an additional 5 feet for every two spell slot levels above 3rd. 
*Rare: Tarol’s Scalding Geyserblast.* The stream is made of pressurized, superheated steam and deals 4d6 bludgeoning and 4d6 fire damage. It lacks the pushing effect, and creatures in the path make a Dexterity save to take half damage instead of a Strength save. 
*Rare: Garnion’s Caustic Geyserblast.* The stream is made of caustic chemicals and deals acid damage instead of bludgeoning.

Scalding Steam 
*3rd-level (conjuration; air, nature, obscurement, water)* 
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard 
**Casting Time:** 1 action 
**Range:** Medium (60 feet) 
**Area:** 15 feet 
**Area Shape:** Sphere 
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) Saving Throw: Constitution halves You conjure up a cloud of searing-hot, heavily-mineralized steam. The spell’s area is lightly obscured, and a creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn or begins its turn there takes 3d6 points of fire damage. A creature that saves takes half damage. 
The steam is also highly-conductive, rendering creatures inside the spell’s area vulnerable to lightning damage.

Steal Breath 
*4th Level (enchantment, affliction, compulsion)* 
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, warlock, witch, wizard 
**Casting Time:** 1 action 
**Target:** One creature 
**Range:** Medium (60ft) 
**Components:** V, M (The lungs of a mudskipper or other lungfish) 
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour) 
As you crush the lung in the palm of your hand, your target feels as if they are drowning on dry land. The target must hold their breath or begin drowning. If they take damage they must make a concentration check to hold their breath. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this spell. 
Creatures that die from the effects of this spell have water filling their lungs and throat. 
*Cast at Higher Levels.* For every level above 4th, you may choose an additional target.
