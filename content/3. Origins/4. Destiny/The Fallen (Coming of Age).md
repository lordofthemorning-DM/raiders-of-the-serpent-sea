You are a wanderer of the world yet have no clear idea why this is so. Beyond the last few years, you have no firm memory of a past life or who (or what) you once were. You awoke in a sea damp cave along the coastline of the towering inner mountains. The cave was situated several hundred feet above the Serpent Sea, and you spent hours climbing down. Eventually you found your way to a small fishing village and found a place there. You have, over time, adjusted to life in Grimnir.

But who are you… where did you come from? Do you have a family? Why did you lose your memories? These questions plague you more in recent weeks as strange dreams have surfaced… dreams of another realm. Another you.

You sense that you must serve a great purpose and you yearn to discover what this must be.

- **Player Interest:** Loki, Angel, The Nameless One
- **Restrictions:** Most options will work, but the game master has the final decision and should be consulted when selecting this option

#### Source of Inspiration
You draw inspiration from setting out with adventure in front of you. You gain inspiration whenever you achieve a personal milestone.  You also gain inspiration everytime you complete one of your Heroic Tasks.
_Join a new guild or organization, travel somewhere new and far from home, accept or complete a new major quest or mission, gain a level, change worldviews and grow as a person._

#### Inspiration Feature
You haven’t had training in everything but you’re determined to give it your all anyway. As a bonus action you may spend your inspiration to gain proficiency with a weapon, armor, skill, or tool for the next hour.

#### Feature: Fate’s Bite (ᛈ)

You have a scar on your hand that resembles the rune ᛈ. 

To the raider people this rune can represent chance or mystery. At certain moments in the story additional runes will be drawn, adding to your story, your abilities, and your penultimate reason for existing.

#### Feature: The Maker

You are connected to the world in ways that you do not understand. At times Grimnir itself guides your hand when you work with the artisan tools you have chosen. You always have advantage when using that tool. Additionally, once per long rest, if you fail a tool’s check, you may choose to succeed.

> _Yay, the not belonging, it’s like skinning your hands on a rough rock you be movin’. Just keep pushing. You either widen that gap and walk on through... or push hard enough and the bastard rolls down a hill and crushes something._

### Suggested Characteristics

The Fallen is a blank slate and can fill many roles in the community they find themselves in. Though lacking in knowledge, they are quick learners and are uncannily wise to the world around them, intuiting the correct way to act, even in unfamiliar situations. Some portion of the life they lived remains with them. Though possibly aloof, they tend to be liked, even respected, by their adopted communities.

### Starting Story Connection

When you heard about the völv’s desire to explore the tower at Kekkell you were intrigued, for your most recent dreams have been showing you a strange ruin, to the south. You have seen yourself walking the halls of an ancient building and you believe you may find a trace of your past at Kekkell. You signed on to become a member of Hrolf’s expedition.

  

#### Heroic Tasks

- **Your Truth.** You must learn what you actually are and where you are from. Reward. Choose any valid feat from the player’s handbook as if you had reached the appropriate level to gain it (all other prerequisites must still be met). This represents remembering a small portion of the person you once were.
- **Why are You Here?** You learn why you are in the world of Grimnir and a hint of how to restore your true self.
- **Reclaim Your Past.** You must discover a way to return to your homeland and to restore as much of yourself as is possible. Reward. You find an item connected to your mysterious past. Pick one of the following:
    - Dragon scale mail (your choice of scales), gifted to you far in the past.
    - A falcon coat that allows you to fly between different locations.

#### Epic Goal: Redeem the Past

Once you discover your past, an ancient threat is revealed that you must vanquish. But it will involve a costly sacrifice and your decision may determine the fate of Grimnir. 

**A Long-Lost Item.** Choose one of the following items:
- staff of the magi
- ring of invisibility
- rod of lordly might
