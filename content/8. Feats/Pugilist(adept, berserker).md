### Pugilist
***Prerequisites:*** *3 levels in berserker, 3 levels in adept (Brawler archetype)*<br>
Some train for years developing the skills to turn their bodies into living weapons. Some just don't give a rats hindquarters and throw themselves into fights unarmed because they can't be bothered to find a weapon.  When you combine both effects into one, you get a Pugilist. These fighters meld discipline and fury into a maelstrom of blows with whatever lies at hand, or even nothing at all, while a combination of grace and power make them wildly unpredictable. Whenever you enter a rage, you gain a temporary pool of exertion points equal to a roll of your martial arts die + the number of rage hit points you would gain each round.  These bonus exertion points disappear at the end of your rage, and can only be used for Flurry of Blows, Unorthodox Arsenal, or to activate maneuvers or focus features that involve making an attack with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon or using a basic maneuver.  You may also use any of your Furious Critical abilities with unarmed strikes and improvised weapons.

### Furious Grace
***Prerequisites:*** *Pugilist feat*<br>
While raging and wearing light or no armor, you have advantage on Dexterity ability checks and saving throws.  If you fail a Strength or Dexterity based ability check or saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll your martial arts die and add it to the total, potentially turning it into a success.

### Sudden Reversal
***Prerequisites:*** *Furious Grace feat*<br>
While raging, as a bonus action you can choose to give opponents advantage on attack rolls against you. If you do so, until the start of your next turn you can spend 1 exertion point to make one attack with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon or perform one basic maneuver each time a creature hits you with an attack. You can use your special exertion pool from the Pugilist feat to do so.<br>
In addition, when you critically hit with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon attack while raging, you deal additional damage equal to a roll of your martial arts die. This is added to the extra damage dealt by the critical hit and is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.
