She was long the leader of the Vanir and carried much guilt with her into Grimnir, having lost her husband and many friends in that ill-fated final battle. She blamed herself for not seeing Mirgal’s treachery earlier and when she found the Well of Wisdom, she gouged out her eye and gave it to the well as atonement.

Some stories say that this loss of an eye made her unable to see the accidental betrayal that was to come from her son, Thonir. Others insist that she gained a new sight and did indeed see all that was to pass, each day up until Ragnarök, making her the very first of the völv. This giftcurse allowed her to prepare the other gods for what was to come. Regardless, unlike the others of the Stone Court, she is believed to interfere in the lives of mortals through her white ravens.
