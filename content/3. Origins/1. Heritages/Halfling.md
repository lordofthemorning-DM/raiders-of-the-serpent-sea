In addition, halflings get access to the following additional paragon gift options:

*Stalwart Companion*- Your natural fearlessness inspires your companions and helps bolster their resolve. Allies that can see you gain an expertise die to saving throws made to resist fear. Additionally, you may use your action to touch one frightened creature, immediately ending the effect on them as you flood them with warmth and positivity. You may do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

*Go to Ground* (Prerequisite: Burrowing Claws heritage gift)- Your natural ability to burrow intensifies. Your burrowing speed increases to 20 feet, and you gain tremorsense out to a range of 15 feet. Additionally, your claws now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances.

in addition, if a mixed heritage character takes the *Increased Luck* paragon gift without having the Halfling Lucky trait, they instead gain the basic Lucky trait (only re-rolling natural 1s).
