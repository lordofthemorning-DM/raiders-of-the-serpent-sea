Hydromancers are something of a contradiction.  They can be as flowing as an Aeromancer, and as forceful as a Geomancer, and switch between the two at the drop of a hat.  More importantly, the deeps hold secrets, and many wizards pursue the path of the Hydromancer specifically for the purpose of plumbing them in their search for knowledge and arcane learning.

### Inescapable Current
When you select this archetype at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell that would forcibly move a creature or knock them prone, they have disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Born to the Waves
Also at 2nd level you gain a swim speed equal to your movement speed.  You also add the create or destroy water spell to your spellbook and it counts as a wizard spell for you.

### Torential Flood
At 6th level whenever you cast a spell that deals force, bludgeoning, acid, or cold damage that requires a saving throw, if the creature fails the save they are either pushed 10 feet away from you or knocked prone, your choice.  If the spell instead requires a spell attack roll, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your wizard spell DC or suffer the same.  Using this ability on a spell causes the spell to benefit from Inescapable Current.  You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Flowing Freedom
At 10th Level you are permanently under the effects of a *freedom of movement* spell.  This cannot be dispelled, though it is suppressed by an antimagic field.  You can also breath underwater.

### Secrets of the Deeps
At 14th level you gain the ability to ritually cast the *commune* spell, contacting an entity of the deeps, once per long rest. In addition you can cast *commune with nature* as a ritual at will, but only in areas with a significant natural body of water (a large river, a swamp, many small rivers, a lake, the coast, at sea, etc.)
