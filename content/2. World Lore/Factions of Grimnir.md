> _My sister, Berghild, and I often snuck out of our farmhouse and waited in the fields, to watch the tomten take food from a plate we set out or sip mead from our mothers’ thimbles. But always our eyelids became heavy and we fell asleep instead of seeing. Yet the food was gone, the mead drank, whenever we did wake.  
> And to watch our mothers at work, the two of them talking to the tomten, as if they truly were there, making the forge hammers strike harder. It is just respect, I guess, to speak to them. Just because we can’t see them doesn’t mean they are not there._

### Raiders
Raiders are pragmatic people that value strength and bravery. They have a tremendous respect for their forebears, the Vanir. Though their martial traditions are most important to them, they also pride themselves on shipbuilding, farming, trading, and respecting their gods through their divine traditions.

Originally a unified people, as their populations grew, the clans expanded. And with that expansion, divisions and competition arose.

The [[Hallharn]], [[Tvar]], and [[Lutan]]s were the first clans to form. Centuries later, the [[Knattle]] and the [[Örn]] sprang from them. Others have since fallen or been folded back into existing clans.

 Additionally, several decades ago, the tallfolk formed a clan, called the Risa, along the southern coast of Turnfjall.

Today, the raiders live in small and medium sized clans, primarily in wooden fortresses inhabiting the coastal fringe of the inner continents and surrounding islands. The clans are often in conflict, if not outright war, with one another.

Their history is primarily passed orally from generation to generation, which grants much respect to their elders who are stewards of knowledge. Hence, the raiders value the words of the völv, who have taken a leading role in guiding the clans towards being a more cohesive whole.

Raiders live every day to its fullest. They eat, drink, and fight with all they have. Celebration—whether it is a victory, a birth, or an alliance—is important. But even still, they are not wasteful or foolish. The chieftains, known as jarls, are cautious with the lives of their warriors. Each raider is highly trained, and their numbers are few; risks are weighed carefully. 

Raiders relish gaining spoils—their reward in the present life for their bravery in battle. These include weapons, armor, coins, as well as thralls. But most warriors are also farmers or fishers and look to expand their land holdings by acquiring new properties that they can farm or fish upon. Wealth takes many forms among the raiders.

Above all, joining their ancestors in the Halls of the Slain is their most valued prize.

#### About Thralls

Thralls are the prisoners the raiders capture after a battle—either from other clans or the Baendur. They become part of an individual warrior’s household—and are never permitted to touch a weapon unless the family adopts them formally. When this happens, the thrall becomes a member of the clan; their past (mostly) forgotten.
#### Turnfjall

The Serpent Sea encircles a mass of land that rises vertically, with its highest peak in the east. Though the lowlands, known simply as the Inner Lands, are fertile and inhabited by many clans, the mountain range, called Turnfjall is seldom explored. Visible from almost every other location in the world, Turnfjall’s cliffs are sheer granite, unscalable, and the only upward passage is to ascend from the Inner Lands, along the western flank.

Yet the daunting forests, and the creatures lurking within, discourage most from even dreaming of the attempt. That, and the many missing clans that have tried to settle deeper. No fewer than three are known to have perished. A few raiders tell tales of mysterious beasts living among those untouched forests, stalking any who stray into their woods. Some villages on the fringes of such forests even perform sacrifices to keep the beasts from straying from their woods.

#### The Fanged Sands

Volcanoes occasionally erupt from the volatile strip of land that forms the world’s southern edge. Lava rock has accumulated and stretches for miles, a vast plain of desolation. From this world’s edge, the land slopes upwards, northward, until it reaches the lakes, rivers, and more fertile lands bordering the Serpent Sea.

The Tower of Kekkell is located on the coast of the Fanged Sands, and Nowhere, the largest community—composed of lesser raiding clans, collectively known as the varang—is in the southeast.

- **The Alljarl.** Each clan has their own jarl but once every eight years they meet at a gathering on the floating town of Drifthall to vote for an Alljarl who loosely leads the united clans in times of conflict. The current Alljarl is Mother Guhnbarg of the Hallharn.
- **The Völv.** Raider history is passed orally from generation to generation, which grants much respect to their elders who are stewards of knowledge. Most respected are the prophetic völv.
- **Ragnarök.** The völv have seen that this world, like the Lost Lands, is destined to end in a cataclysmic battle. Each day of a raider’s life is lived preparing for this inevitability.
- The current Raider clans and groups are as follows: [[Hallharn]], [[Risa]], [[Knattle]], [[Lutan]], [[The Völv & Drifthall]], [[Tvar]], [[Whar]], [[Örn]], and the [[Varang]].

### The Baendur
Several dozen kingdoms are scattered across the world, especially in the High North and along the western edge of the world. Few kingdoms make serious attempts to expand, especially not into raider territory, but they require trade with one another and do risk the seas, providing ripe targets for raiders to plunder. The most powerful Baendur is King Cenric Edgare.

Loosely connected, more by philosophy than direct connections, the kingdoms should not be considered a single cohesive whole. There is only the occasional migration between them—and the rare royal marriage of kingdoms situated geographically near one another.

The closest to an axis of power that exists is Cenric Edgare’s family. His bloodline is believed to have originated with the Witchking himself, but Edgare, like all Baendur, now realizes it is important to avoid the raiders. Drawing their attention is to invite ruin. That is not to say there is never the occasional war between the kingdoms themselves; in the west there have been numerous conflicts even in recent years.

**Note**. Baendur means, “Sinks Fast” in the dialect of the raiders. 

#### The Western Shores

These fertile lands have remained in the Baendur’s hands owing to the formidable defenses of the inner kingdoms, the natural fortifications provided by the Winefrost mountains, and the raiders lack of knowledge of the continent’s geography.

#### The Eastern Stretch

The lava plains that dominate the southern and eastern stretches of the world give way to slightly more forested areas and some farmyard, though not as bountiful as the Western Shores. The kingdoms that exist here are poorer and less organized than in the west.

#### High North

The borderlands in the north are home to varying biomes and peoples. Vast evergreen forests support sufficient game to feed clans such as the Whar as well as several Baendur kingdoms. Elsewhere, the hardy Knattle raiders eke out a grueling existence upon vast plains of ice, competing with, and exploiting, the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros that roam there. A few northern temples, their former occupants unknown, are occasionally discovered by stalwart explorers.

> _Visited the old Baendur kingdoms, before the Witchking, I did. Beautiful castles they had, but their ruins belong to the Lutan and Tvar now. Those raider lands were the Baendur homeland once, but they spread themselves thin, that is truth. Wars were lost and their middle faltered, kept only the appendages, if you understand._

### The Witches of The Ironwood
> _The making of oaths, the mingling of blood, these rituals come from before, from the Lost Lands. Raiders, even Baendur, take the words most serious. As well they should. For some of that old power, in the vows we make, it lingers._  
> – Otis the Historian

## Witches of the Ironwood
On only the clearest of days along the northern coast of Turnfjall a great forest of iron leafed trees can be seen many miles inland, rising along the steep rock walls of the near impenetrable mountain ranges. This forest of ironheart trees has long been avoided by raiders, with stories of strange creatures moving through its deep, dark woods. This is the Ironwood Forest and is home to the Witchking and his red robed cohort of witches.

Some say the witches sacrifice children to the trees through gruesome rituals. Others insist that the witches themselves grow from the ironheart trees and if those trees are ever discovered outside the Ironwood itself, they must be cut down, and swiftly. What is known for certain is that during the height of the storm season, on any night when the moon is full, all raiders keep those they love safe inside their lodges. For that is when the witch party rides their strange beasts, with the Witchking at the head of the terrible procession. Their red robes flutter behind them like blood trails as their dread hunting party descends upon a helpless homestead, slaughtering every man, woman, child, and beast.

## Grimnir Newcomers
The life of a newcomer to Grimnir is often unpleasant. After they survive the inhospitable terrain and weather they may be taken as thralls by raiders unless they are able to prove their mettle in battle. Usually only after living among the raiding clans a generation or two will their offspring have the option of bettering themselves and becoming full members of the clan.

Among the Baendur, life is potentially worse, for thralls seldom rise beyond their station. There are servants among the powerful noble families whose family have served in that role for numerous generations.

Regardless, newcomers also must become familiar with the customs and oaths of their new lands. The raiders understand their world and do not often think to explain it to others, which can create problems. A newcomer may, for example, swear an oath of duty without really understanding what it means.
