House Rules

Druids add the ceremony spell to their spell list.

While wildshaped, if your new form has an ability with a saving throw DC, you may use the creature's DC or your spell save DC, whichever is higher.

The following additional Secrets of Nature are allowed:
### BEYOND NATURAL
There are many creatures normally regarded as unnatural, but in your heart these creatures still have a right to exist and a place within the natural world. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks regarding monstrosities and may treat non-sentient monstrosities as if they were beasts for the purposes of Animal Handling. In addition, spells and features that allow you to communicate with beasts apply to monstrosities as well.
### BIRDSINGER 
*Prerequisite: A Way With Animals* 
You share a kinship with the feathered and taloned, and the chorus of morning birdsong is akin to your daily news. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks regarding birds and other feathered creatures. In addition, at dawn you can spend 10 minutes and join the chorus of morning birdsong and converse about local events. If you do, you learn the following information regarding the area of the surrounding 5 mile radius: 
- Any notable locations that differ greatly from the surroundings in the area. 
- Any unusual movements of creatures within the last 24 hours within the area. 
- Any predators or other threats to birds within the area. 
- Any other notable events within the area that would be visible from the air within the last 24 hours. 
To use this ability there must be birds or other forms of avian life common to the area.
### HORSE WHISPERER 
You share a kinship with the strong and the swift, and you easily ride together and share each other's burdens. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks regarding horses and other pack animals. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes bonding with any mount. You treat mounts you bond with in this way as if they had the loyal and willing mount traits while you are bonded with them. When you bond with a mount you lose any previous bonds with other mounts made in this way.
### PREDATORY AURA 
You regard yourself as an apex predator sitting atop the natural world rather than living harmoniously with it, and creatures can sense your predatory intent. You gain an expertise die on all Intimidation checks regarding beasts and plants. In addition, whenever a beast or plant attempts to attack you, they must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your spellcasting DC. On a failed save the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw creatures are immune to this effect for 24 hours. 
### RODENT HEART 
You share a kinship with the small and furry, and share their nervous energy and penchant for small spaces. You can move through spaces one size smaller than your own without squeezing. In addition, your flight reflex is so high-tuned that you may move normally while surprised, but you can only take the Dash action, and you still cannot take other actions or reactions when surprised as normal.
### SHEPHERD OF GLADES 
Even in the darkest forest, you can find the safe pastures and calm glades in which to rest your head. When you take the Scout journey activity while traveling through grasslands, hills, forests, or jungles, on a success or critical success you additionally locate a safe glade. Safe glades you find in this way count as havens. You may only use this ability once per region, but you can always relocate safe glades you have found in the past. 
### WEB WEAVER 
You share a kinship with the weavers of silken strands, and similarly enjoy the deadly beauty of the web. You ignore the movement restrictions imposed by webs and automatically succeed on any saving throws caused by the web spell or similar effects. In addition, once you are at least a 3rd-level druid you learn the spell web which counts as a druid spell for you. 
### WOLF SPIRIT 
You share a kinship with the wolves, and find it hard to resist howling at the moon. You gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks regarding wolves and other canine creatures. In addition, you gain the ability to howl like a wolf as an action. This wolf howl is magically amplified, and is audible up to a range of 5 miles. This howl can carry information in Druidic, and can be understood by wolves, canines, and other creatures that can understand Druidic.
