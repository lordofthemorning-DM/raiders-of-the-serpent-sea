Shadowtouched sorcerers are those who were born into darkness, and took the darkness into them.  Sometimes this is the result of a baleful curse, other times the influence of the plane of shadows, and sometimes even darker and more mysterious things.  Whatever the source, they find themselves more at home in the shadows than the light, and draw upon darkness and all it hides for their magic.

### Born to the Darkness
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with your choice of Stealth or Deception, 120ft darkvision and you know the *darkness* spell and it does not count against your number of spells known. You can cast *darkness* without expending a spell slot.  Once you have done so you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.   When casting *darkness* you may expend 1 sorcery point to have it last its full duration without concentration, though you may only have one *darkness* spell active at a time.
### Fear of the Dark
At 6th level you may spend 2 sorcery points as an action to target a creature you can see within 30 feet. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute.  They may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.  If they start their turn blinded or unable to see as a result of darkness, they count as being able to see the source of their fear, and if they start their turn blinded or in darkness they cannot see through they take 2d6 psychic damage.  You may only have one creature frightened in this way at a time.

### Under Cover of Darkness
At 14th level, your darkvision can see through magical darkness.  If you start your turn in dim light or darkness you can teleport to another area of dim light or darkness you can see within 30ft as a bonus action.

### Living Shadow
At 18th level as an action you may become a living shadow for 1 minute.  As long as you are in dim light or darkness you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant, can take the hide action as a bonus action even without cover, and can move through solid objects as difficult terrain.  If you end your turn in a solid object you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage.  Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
