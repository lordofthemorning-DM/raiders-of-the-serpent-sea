Enchanters are witches who specialize in magic that manipulates, controls, or befuddles the mind.  While they can be benevolent and use their powers for good, those enchanters who do turn to darker motivations and aims are among the most terrifying of their kind, so much so that their reputation tends to bleed over and affect all enchanters, and indeed all witches.
### Enchanting Presence
When you select this archetype at 2nd level you add the enchantment spell school to your list of witch spells. <br>
You also gain proficiency with persuasion and deception, or an expertise die if already proficient.

### Snare Unwary Minds
At 6th level you are incredibly skilled at making good first impressions, enhanced by bewitching magic too subtle to work on any but the unaware.  When making your first persuasion or deception check against a creature you have never met before and who doesn't know you, you have advantage.

### Fascination
At 10th level you may use an action to cause any number of humanoids, giants, fey, or monstrosities to make a wisdom save against your spell save DC.  On a failure, they are entranced by you until the start of your next turn. Their movement speed is 0 and they are incapacitated. This effect ends early if they take any damage, or if another creature uses their action to shake them out of it. At the start of your next turn if any creatures are still affected, you may expend an additional use of this ability to extend the effect. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Monstrosities are only affected if they have an intelligence of 7 or higher.

### Molder of Hearts and Minds
Starting at 14th level, you always have the *dominate person* and *mass suggestion* spells prepared and they don't count against your number of prepared spells.  You may cast one of these spells at their lowest spell level without expending a spell slot. Once you have cast a spell this way, you cannot cast either spell in this manner until you finish a long rest. You also learn the rare Spells *Gorana's inveigling charm person* and *Gorana's inveigling charm monster* (both originally published in Mysterious and Marvelous Miscellanea, included below) without needing to research them.



#### Gorana's Inveigling Charm Person 
The duration of the spell is increased to 8 hours, 24 hours with a 5th or higher level spell slot. In addition, you may increase the casting time to 1 hour to instead have the duration last a year or until dispelled or dismissed by you. If the target is already charmed by you they have disadvantage on the saving throw against this longer cast time version, but on successful save are immune to that version cast by you for 1 year. If you expend a 6th or higher level spell slot you may instead target a creature up to 1 mile away using the 1 hour cast time version provided you have a piece of them to use as a material component.
