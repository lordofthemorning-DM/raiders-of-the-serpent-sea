House Rules

Enigma Sorcerers add the *unstable blast*, *adhering Blast*, and *chaos field* spells to their list of archetype spells in place of *faerie fire*, *stinking cloud*, and *hallucinatory terrain*.  These new spells are all from MoAR Complete

In addition, whenever you cast a spell of 6th level or higher, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you trigger a wild magic surge. When you use Retributive Surge, roll 1d20 and triger a surge on a roll equal to or lower than the level of spell you cast as a reaction. When you use Erupting Nova, you automatically trigger a surge if you fail the save in addition to removing the two spells from your spell list.

The following wild magic table will be used, with the following adjustments:
7- Instead of Dragon's Breath, casts the Chromatic Beam spell aimed in a random direction and including you in it's area of effect
13- The narrator must call for this disadvantage before your next long rest or the effect fades, and if you roll this result again before they have done so it has no effect.
27- Also prevents casting spells with a Seen or Material component for the duration; the exception is non-costly Material components if you have a spell focus that does not need to be held, like a focus tattoo.
29- Immediately advances you one step on the [[Intoxicated]] condition track instead of the listed effect.
50 and 51- both prevent you from casting spells with Vocalized components for the duration.
71- This instead immediately grants you one additional magically created Supply.
75- This reduced any walking or climb speed you have to 10ft and reduces any fly or swim speed you have to 0ft.
91- You learn a random 1st level sorcerer spell, which fades when you next long rest.
