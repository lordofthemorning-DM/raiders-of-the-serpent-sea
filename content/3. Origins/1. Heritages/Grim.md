> _"Though I’ve yet to meet a grim as old as myself, they are long lived. And in those long lives, they have seen much. Seldom have I spent a more pleasant evening than among the grims, sharing tall tales and listening to their delightful music. Their perspective is unusual for they see the world quite differently than those of us who live most of our lives on the surface. Yet, they can become restless and short-tempered, especially if reminded of all they believe they have lost. Respect those moments and leave them be; never overstay your welcome!"  
> _—Otis the Historian

The grims are children of Grimnir. Most are comfortable beneath murky lake waters in forests that no raider has ever found. Others were forced to flee their refuges, pushed out by raiders, Baendur, and monsters. The grim often form small communities that linger near, but not entirely within, existing raider towns. They fish, they mend nets, and, for coin or food, they might even sing in feast halls.

Though many grims still lament the lives they have lost, the younger generation embraces the dynamic communities of the raiders. They long to spread their music to shores far and wide across all of Grimnir. 

### Creatures of the Water

All grims long for water—whether sea, river, or pool. It is comforting to them to be submerged and to stare up at the world around them, watching and observing from a distance. Grims breathe underwater through a primal magic that no mortal truly understands.

Their ears are wide and pointed, and they tend to have green or blue skin to blend in with their murky habitats. Their eyes are often light yellow or green, and skin flaps on their arms and legs can extend, helping them swim.

### Of Two Natures

Grims have conflicted souls. They originated with Grimnir when it was created and perhaps their internal conflict arises from the turmoil that surrounded that creation. Some grims live their entire lives indulging in their music—performing or teaching others how to play instruments, sing, and entertain. Others resent the encroachment of mortals into their pools and waterfalls and do what they can to deter trespassers.

But it is never so simple. For within each grim is the capacity for both a deep love and appreciation of life as well as a cruel selfishness. As events in their lives unfold, they may change their very nature and walk many different paths.

### Grim Names

Their names tend to be that of the community of which they are a part, though they prefer short names, often with only a single syllable.
