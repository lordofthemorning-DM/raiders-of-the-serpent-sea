After a night of hard-partying, your body has some things to say to you. When you are hungover, you experience the following effects: 
- Hungover creatures have a –2 penalty to Constitution saving throws until they complete a short or long rest. 
- A hungover creature cannot take reactions. 
- A hungover creature has disadvantage on Perception checks. 
- Creatures that are immune to poison or the poisoned condition cannot be hungover.


### Avoiding a Hangover 
A player character who consumed enough alcoholic beverages to become inebriated the night before must make a Constitution saving throw to determine if they are hungover the following day. The DC of this saving throw is equal to **5 × the level of inebriated the adventurer obtained.** For example, if an adventurer reached inebriated level 3, they would need to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or experience a hangover. Conversely, an adventurer who only reached level 1 would need to make a DC 5 saving throw to avoid the consequences of their actions.
