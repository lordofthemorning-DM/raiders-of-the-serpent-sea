When you finish a long rest, you may summon up and drink a draught from the mystical well of the Norns.  If you do so, once per short or long rest you may use a reaction on either missing an attack, failing a saving throw, an opponent succeeding on a saving throw, or being hit be an attack roll to replace the result of the d20 roll with your choice of a natural 2 or a natural 16.  If you do so the result cannot be re-rolled in any way.
