Crownsworn are heralds sworn not to a god or religion, or philosophic or moral ideal, but to something more tangible.  They bind themselves to queens, emperors, generals, or more broadly to nations, peoples, or clans, in some cases the herald themselves being a king, chief, or other leader, so long as they are dedicated to serving their subjects and not just the other way around.  Their loyalty and service to those they serve is absolute, so much so their devotion itself manifests divine power.

Regardless of the the ruler or nation they serve all crownsworn hold similar tenets.
- **My Country, Right or Wrong.**  Your devotion to your ruler and/or nation must be absolute and you must defend their honor in all things.  Your cannot be led astray by the whims of fickle morality, for you serve something greater, a legacy that stretches beyond a single action, moment, or even ruler. 
- **Heavy is the Head that Wears the Crown.**  If you are a ruler you are bound by burdens and responsibilities heavier than any subject could realize.  You must bear them dutifully and without complaint, or if sworn to a leaderâ€™s service do all you can to aid them in their task and lighten their load.
- **Your Life Belongs to your People Now.**  Do not heedlessly endanger yourself or recklessly throw your life away for it does not belong to you.  It belongs to your liege, as theirs belongs to their subjects.  Seek not personal glory, but only to glorify those you are beholden to.
- **The King and the Land are One.**  The leader and those they lead cannot be severed.  As the ruler prospers, so do their people, and as they falter so to does the nation.  In return, they take and bear full responsibility for the actions, good or ill, of their subjects and must strive ever for their well being.
