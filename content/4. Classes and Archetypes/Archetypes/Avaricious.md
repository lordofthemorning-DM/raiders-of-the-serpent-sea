Greed. It drives, it corrupts, and it provides. For warlocks who turn their lust for wealth into a bargain for power, there is great luxury—and great depravity, if one is not careful—to be had. These warlocks always get their cut, always get their beak wet, always want just a little off the top. They don’t need everything, not really. Just more than they had yesterday. Forever. 

### Powered By Greed 
When you take this archetype at 1st level, your lust for wealth fuses with your magical power. In addition, choose one of the following: 
#### Larcenous Curse 
You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated . The curse has the following effects: When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level. Every time you damage the creature, you gain a Cursed Coin. At 10th level, this increases to 2 Cursed Coins, and at 5th level, it increases to 3. You can spend Cursed Coins like electrum pieces at a 1:1 ratio, but you must receive some good or service from the transaction, and they cannot be given away. Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
#### Kickback 
Whenever you or another creature within 60 feet of you casts a spell with a costly material component, you receive 30% of the gp value of the consumed component as Cursed Coin. You can spend Cursed Coins like electrum pieces at a 1:1 ratio, but you must receive some good or service from the transaction, and they cannot be given away. 
At 11th level, your Cursed Coins can be spent as gold rather than electrum. In all cases, they appear to the seller as normal coins of their corresponding type and become that type of currency once the transaction is complete and they are in the seller’s possession. 

### Retainer 
At 6th level, you gain one inexperienced follower. At 14th level, you gain an additional follower or your follower becomes more experienced. 

### Blood Money 
Also at 6th level, whenever you reduce a creature with a CR equal to at least half your level to 0 hit points, it dies and you gain Cursed Coins equal to its CR. You can only receive this benefit once from a given creature, even if it is later returned to life (or undeath). 

### Pilfering Payback 
Finally at 6th level, you learn the Painful Pickpocket maneuver. When you use the maneuver, instead of paying the cost with exertion, you can spend a warlock spell point to pay its exertion cost. 

### The Root of All Kinds of Evil 
Beginning at 10th level, you learn two spells of the Evil school of levels you can cast and can spend Cursed Coins instead of spell points when you cast a spell of the Evil school that you know. Once you have cast a spell this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. 
In addition, if a spell of the Evil school has a costly material component, you can provide Cursed Coins equal to half the cost of the component instead of the component. 

### Personal Holdings 
Also at 10th level, you gain a luxurious grade 3 stronghold of the castle, house or mead type. Unlike usual strongholds, you are unable to sell this stronghold. 
### Passive Income 
Beginning at 14th level, your connection to the cosmic forces of greed pays you a dividend without the need for you to do anything. When you finish a long rest, you gain Cursed Coins equal to your proficiency bonus. 

### Hand in every Pocket 
Also at 14th level, you learn the Pickpocket and Pilfer Object maneuvers. When you use one of these maneuvers, instead of paying the cost with exertion, you can spend warlock spell points to pay its exertion cost.

Additional Archetype specific Eldritch Invocation:
### Midas Touch 
*Prerequisites: 11th level, Avaricious Archetype* 
Once per long rest, you can cast flesh to stone without using a spell slot, but the range is reduced to touch. However, if the target is permanently petrified, instead of being turned to mundane stone, it is shot through with gold ore. If the petrified creature is mined for the ore (which takes an hour and shatters the petrified creature to pieces, meaning that restoring requires life-restoring magic rather than just reversing the petrification), it is worth 20x the creature’s CR in gold. Creatures with a CR of less than 1 yield gold worth 1 electrum piece’s worth of gold ore.
