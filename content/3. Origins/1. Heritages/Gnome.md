In addition, gnomes also get access to the following additional heritage gift option:

*Elemental Connection*- You possess a natural connection to one of the four elements. Choose one of the following spells: *air wave*, *create or destroy water*, *grease*, or *burning hands*. You learn this spell and may cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot or using material components. Your spellcasting ability modifier is either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest. A spell learned in this way does not count against the number of spells you know.

They also have the following additional Paragon Gift options:

*Elemental Master* (Prerequisite: Elemental Connection heritage gift)- You tap further into your connection to your chosen element, allowing you to call forth a manifestation of it for aid. You learn the *conjure elemental* spell and may cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot. The type of elemental conjured by this spell must match the element of the spell chosen via your Elemental Connection heritage gift. 

*Warden of Stone*- You are a creature of the earth, and you harness your connection to it for your protection. As a bonus action, you may turn your flesh into stone, gaining resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the next minute. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
