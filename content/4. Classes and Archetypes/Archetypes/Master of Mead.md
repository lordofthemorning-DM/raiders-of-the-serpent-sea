Mead is a gift from the gods themselves, and nothing quenches a raider's thirst after a hard voyage or pitched battle quite like it.  While many ordinary people take to brewing a variety of strains of this preferred drink, there are those who take to it as a holy calling, and such Masters of Mead are welcome in any hold.

### Bonus Proficiencies 
When you choose this archetype at 1st level, you gain proficiency with brewerâ€™s supplies, or an expertise die if you were already proficient. You may always choose to use Wisdom when making checks with this toolkit. 

### POTENT BREW 
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to infuse your brew with healing energies. You may turn a number of bottles of beer, mead, spirits, or wine equal to your proficiency bonus into a basic healing potion per day. The process to bless the beverage in this way takes 10 minutes, and it may be done as part of a short or a long rest. These potions cannot be sold and last for 24 hours, at which point they turn into bitter vinegar. These potions may be greater healing potions starting at 6th level, and superior healing potions beginning at 12th level.

### CHANNEL DIVINITY: LIFE OF THE PARTY 
Beginning at 2nd level, you may use Channel Divinity to infect your foes with a case of the giggles. Choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The targeted creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save DC or begin to laugh uncontrollably. So long as you can maintain concentration, the affected creature is incapacitated. The affected creature may repeat their saving throw at the end of each of its turns or whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. Creatures who succeed on their saving throw are immune to this laughter for 24 hours. The number of creatures you may affect with this ability increases to 2 starting at 5th level, and to 3 starting at 15th level.

### DELETERIOUS DELIRIUM 
Starting at 6th level, when a target fails a saving throw against one of your spells by 5 or more, the creature becomes confused until the end of their next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### SUDDEN HANGOVER 
Beginning at 8th level, when you hit with a cleric cantrip or a melee weapon attack, you may add psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. If your attack scores a critical hit, the creature gains the [[Hungover]] condition until the end of your next turn.

### MIND ERASER 
At 17th level, you have mastered the pinnacle of your craft. Once per day, you may use your Potent Brew feature to create one supreme healing potion. You may only create one, but unlike other potions created by your Potent Brew, it does not spoil. 
Additionally, once per day you may expend one use of your Channel Divinity to cast the spell feeblemind. This also counts as a cleric spell for you and may be prepared alongside your spells as normal.
