It seems unlikely that anyone has ever landed on a remote island, traversed an arctic tundra, or scouted a subterranean cavern that a Wayfinder has not found first. These world-class explorers are invaluable members of any expedition into unmapped lands and waters, able not only to traverse any kind of terrain and almost intuit what lies over the next horizon, but also (and perhaps more importantly) to find their way back home when the adventure is done. 

### EXPLORER’S KEN 
At 3rd level, you have become adept at guiding others across uncharted regions. You gain proficiency with navigator’s tools, cartographer’s tools, and one type of vehicle of your choice. If you are already proficient in any of these tools, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain the Guide exploration knack, or another exploration knack if you already have it. This does not count against your total exploration knacks known. 

### ALWAYS FORWARD 
Also at 3rd level, you are equipped to overcome any natural obstacle. You gain an expertise die when making saving throws to resist fatigue following a forced march. In addition, choose one of the following options: 
#### SPECIALIZED EXPLORER 
You gain an additional secret of nature from the druid class, and it does not count against your total exploration knacks known. 
#### WORLD-WANDERER 
You gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your speed, or increase these speeds by 10 feet if you already have them. In addition, your speed is only reduced by 5 feet instead of halved when crawling, squeezing, or traversing difficult terrain. 

### HORIZON SCANNER 
At 7th level, your vision has grown keen from long practice looking for subtle signs at great distances. You can see through heavily obscured areas as though they were lightly obscured, and through lightly obscured areas as though they were not obscured. If you have darkvision, this feature allows you to see in darkness as though it were bright light within the range of your darkvision, and as though it were dim light beyond that range, although you still can only perceive shades of gray in the dark. If you do not have darkvision, this feature functionally gives you darkvision at unlimited range.<br>
In addition, you have advantage on sight-based Perception checks, and when visibility is clear you can make out fine details at extreme ranges, discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across. 

### UNCANNY NAVIGATOR 
At 11th level, your ability to parse unfamiliar environments appears almost preternatural to others. You always know if the surrounding terrain has been influenced or modified by magic, although you do not necessarily know how it has been changed. In addition, you always know the direction and distance of any location you have visited before, and you have advantage on ability checks made to determine the shortest path to specific, immobile locations on your current plane whose existence you are aware of, as well as to the nearest generic geographic feature of a given kind, such as a mountain, river, settlement, island, etc. 

### EARLY EXPLORER 
Also at 11th level, you gain one of the options from the 19th-level Extreme Exploration feature. If you already possess the benefit you choose or gain it again later, you instead gain the following substitution: 
- Cold damage resistance: Cold damage immunity 
- Fire damage resistance: Fire damage immunity 
- Poison Immunity: Immunity to all poisons and poisoned condition 
- Climbing speed: +10 to climbing speed 
- Swimming speed: +10 to swimming speed

### LEAD THE WAY 
At 15th level, others have learned to trust your example and confidently follow in your footsteps. Whenever you succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against an effect, any of your allies who observed you gain advantage on their next saving throw against the same effect in the next 10 minutes. Likewise, whenever you succeed on an Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Stealth, or Survival check, any allies that observed you have advantage on their next check to perform the same activity using the same skill in the next 10 minutes. This ability applies even if your check or saving throw would otherwise be considered simultaneous with that of your ally, such as when making a group ability check, or if you and an ally are both targeted by the same spell. If the check or saving throw is simultaneous, you may also choose one ally to automatically succeed on the check or saving throw instead of gaining advantage.
