Note: several maneuvers in this tradition require a character to have an unused spell slot of a certain level or a certain number of unspent spell points in order to use them.  As such, it should only be taken by characters with access to spellcasting.  Unlike [[Cutting Omen]], which is themed around Arcane magic, this tradition is based around divine magic, and as such is of less likely to be of use outside of heralds and certain multiclass combinations (mostly involving the cleric).  There are builds that can make it work otherwise though, just be careful before you choose it.  If a maneuver says a spell must be prepared, a spell known on a class like bard, sorcerer, warlock, etc. counts.

### Rapid Silvering (1 point) 
*1st degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirements:*** *a silver object no smaller than a coin, a weapon with a metal striking surface, a spell of the transmutation school prepared, and either an unused first-level or higher spell slot or 2 or more spell points* <br>
You quickly plate the weapon with silver and take the Attack action with it (including any additional attacks from the Extra Attack or similar features). It counts as a silvered weapon for this Attack action and until the beginning of your next turn, at which point the silver flakes off and is lost. While the weapon is silvered this way, creatures with damage immunity or resistance that can be bypassed by silver take an additional d6 points of radiant damage from attacks made with it. 

### Sacred Deluge (1 point) 
*1st degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirements:*** *a vial of holy water and a weapon that deals bludgeoning damage* <br>
You toss the vial into the air and violently smash it with your weapon, creating a 15-foot cone of splashed holy water and shards of glass. Creatures in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 points of piercing damage and be affected by the splashed with holy water (taking 2d6 radiant damage if they are an undead or fiend) on a failed save. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage from both the glass shards and holy water. 

### Radiant Salvage (1 point) 
*1st degree Sanctified Steel bonus action* <br>
***Requirements:*** *must have dealt radiant damage with an action earlier this turn* <br>
You quickly salvage some of the lingering radiant damage still at your disposal and make a melee weapon attack against a target you can reach. This attack deals normal weapon damage plus an additional 1d4 radiant damage. 

### Battle Healer Stance (2 points) 
*1st degree Sanctified Steel bonus action (stance)* <br>
***Requirements:*** *a spell of the healing school of 1st level or higher prepared and a spell slot or sufficient resources available to cast it.* <br>
If you lose the ability to cast the spell (such as by spending the spell slot or sufficient points to make it unavailable for casting) this stance ends immediately The first time you deal damage with a melee weapon attack against a creature with a CR equal to half your character level or greater each turn, you or a conscious ally within 30 feet of you is healed a number of hit points equal to half your proficiency bonus. 

### Turning Strike (1 point) 
*2nd-degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirements:*** *ability to turn at least one creature type, a use of Channel Divinity available* <br>
Make a melee weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, it takes normal weapon damage and is also affected as if you had used Turn Undead on it (forcing a save and the usual results from that save as normal, but using the higher of your maneuver or spell save DC). This does not expend your use of Channel Divinity, but it also does not affect any other creatures. 

### Stabilizing Critical (1 point) 
*2nd-degree Sanctified Steel reaction <br>
***Requirement:*** *you must have a spell of the healing school prepared and sufficient resources to cast it.* <br>
When you score a critical hit, you may use your reaction to heal an unconscious creature making death saves within 30 feet of you a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + your Charisma modifier.

### Exorcizing Assault (2 points) 
*2nd-degree Sanctified Steel bonus action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *a vial of holy water* <br>
You whisper a prayer and anoint your weapon with holy water, expending the vial. For the rest of your turn, if you make weapon attacks against a creature that is possessed by another entity, the damage passes harmlessly through the host and damages the possessing entity directly. 

### Radiant Arc (1 point) 
*3rd-degree Sanctified Steel reaction* <br>
When you deal radiant damage with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 points of radiant damage to 2 other targets within 10 feet of the original target. 

### Blinding Flash (1 point) 
*3rd-degree Sanctified Steel reaction* <br>
***Requirements:*** *you must be wielding a silvered weapon or a shield polished to a reflective sheen and you must have a spell of the radiant school prepared and sufficient resources to cast it.* <br>
In response to being targeted by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a brilliant flash of light off your weapon or shield. The attacking creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its turn, which occurs swiftly enough to impose disadvantage on the triggering attack (possibly causing it to miss). 

### Escalating Judgment (2 points) 
*4th degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirements:*** *a vial of holy water and a spell of the radiant school prepared and sufficient resources to cast it* <br>
You splash the target with the holy water, expending it, and then take the Attack action including any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack or similar features. Your first melee weapon attack that hits the target this turn deals an additional d4 of radiant damage, your second deals an additional d6, your third a d8, and so on, up to a maximum die size of a d12. 

### Radiant Warrior Stance (2 points) 
*4th degree Sanctified Steel bonus action (stance)* <br>
***Requirements:*** *a spell that deals radiant damage prepared and sufficient resources to cast it. If you lose the ability to cast the spell (such as by spending the spell slot or sufficient points to make it unavailable for casting) this stance ends immediately* <br>
You tap into the latent radiant power of your magic. As long as you remain in this stance, you gain the following benefits: 
- You cast dim light to a range of 10 feet. As a bonus action, you can spend an additional point of exertion to increase the light you shed to 30 feet of bright light and a further 30 feet of dim light until the beginning of your next turn. The 30-foot radius of bright light counts as sunlight. 
- When a creature of the aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead type damages you in melee, it takes a point of radiant damage and must make a Constitution save against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, it is rattled. If it fails by 5 points or more, it is also blinded. Both effects last until the end of its next turn. 
- Melee weapons you wield deal an extra point of radiant damage and always count as magical against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. 
- If your wielded weapon has a permanent +1, +2, or +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, you also increase your maneuver DC for Sanctified Steel maneuvers by that much.

### Shapeshifterâ€™s Bane (2 points) 
*5th-degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *a silvered or magic weapon* <br>
***Prerequisite:*** *Extra Attack* <br>
You attack a target that can shapeshift, attempting to force it back into its true form. You take the Attack action, including any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack or similar features and must target a single creature with all of your attacks. For each attack that hits, the target must make a save against your maneuver DC or be forced into its true form. This spell also ends spells such as polymorph or class features such as Wild Shape that cause a creature to change its shape. If the target is already in its true form, it takes damage as normal, but suffers no additional effects. If a creature fails its save and you still have attacks remaining, you likewise make them as normal. 

### Wickedness Breaking Strike (3 points) 
*5th-degree Sanctified Steel action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *you must be concentrating on a spell of the radiant school to use this maneuver* <br>
***Prerequisite:*** *Extra Attack* <br>
You make a single weapon attack against the target. If it hits, you deal damage as if you had hit with as many weapon attacks as you can make with Extra Attack, plus one (for example, if you can attack twice with Extra Attack, roll the damage of three attacks) and you lose concentration on the spell after the attack deals damage (allowing you to benefit from any attack benefits provided by the spell before concentration is lost). If this attack is a critical hit, it deals no additional damage, but you do not lose concentration on the spell.
