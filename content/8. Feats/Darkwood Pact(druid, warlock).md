### Darkwood Pact 
***Prerequisites:** 3 levels in druid, 3 levels in warlock* <br>
You have made contact with something in the deep parts of the world, whether literal or metaphorical and it has changed you and your connection to nature. You gain the following benefits: 
- Your Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You may change your warlock spellcasting ability to Wisdom if you desire. Once made, this choice is permanent. 
- Your warlock levels count as druid levels for the purpose of your Wild Shape feature. Additionally, choose a creature type from the following list: aberration, celestial, fey, monstrosity, or undead. You may select creatures of the chosen type as wild shape options, but when wild shaping into one of them, you must spend warlock spell points equal to its CR. 
- You gain the following additional warlock expanded spell list in addition to any you already possess: Darkwood.
	- 1st: bane, entangle 
	- 2nd: blindness/deafness, find steed 
	- 3rd: cobra’s spit, conjure animals 
	- 4th: black tentacles, blight 
	- 5th: contagion, insect plague 

### Warden of the Shadowed Grove 
***Prerequisite:** Darkwood Pact feat* <br>
You have integrated your eldritch power and your mastery of nature together into something greater. You gain the following benefits: 
- When you would learn a Secret of Nature or Secret of Arcana, you can choose freely from either list. 
- Half your druid levels count as warlock levels for the purpose of the Extra Blast and Eldritch Evolution features. 
- While you are wildshaped, you gain the Eldritch Scythe option for your Eldritch Blast if you do not already have it. While you are wildshaped, all (instead of half) your druid levels count as warlock levels for the purpose of the Extra Blast feature, but you can only use the Eldritch Scythe option at this higher level; if you use a different version of Eldritch Blast, it is calculated as above. Your Eldritch Scythe takes on the appearance of your wild shaped form’s natural attacks.

### Tender of the Midnight Copse 
***Prerequisite:** Warden of the Shadowed Grove feat* <br>
You stand beside and beyond nature. Whether you still tend it is your own choice to make. You gain the following benefits: 
- Your Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- When your warlock and druid levels total 13, you gain the Pactkeeper’s Reward invocation for free, but you must choose Pact of the Chain if you do not already have it. 
- You gain additional benefits based on your pact boon(s): 
- If you have Pact of the Blade, your pact weapon can harvest magical essence from your foes. When you score a critical hit with your pact weapon, you regain a spell point. You also learn the altered strike cantrip. 
- If you have Pact of the Chain, your familiar’s form becomes a bit … unusual. It can slip through spaces as narrow as an inch without squeezing and critical hits against it are treated as regular hits. You are also constantly under the effects of speak with animals and speak with plants. 
- If you have Pact of the Tome, your Book of Shadows empowers you to move in unexpected ways. You learn the misty step spell as your choice of a druid or warlock spell. Additionally, once per long rest, you may cast tree stride without using a spell slot.
