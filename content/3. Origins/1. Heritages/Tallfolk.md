> _"They tell me it was the Witches that set me in the boughs of that great old ironheart tree, deep in the woods north of the Risa that found me. I don’t know, I don’t. I was wee then. But I tell you truth, there’s a stirring when I look up at that mountain. A longing. One day I may have to wander thataway. That’s why I keep to the Sea, my back to Turnfjall as much as I can."_

Since the Exodus, tales of enormous men and women appearing in the forests of Turnfjall have spread. Over time a community of these large humanoids have formed a clan of their own—the Risa. 

The true origins of the tallfolk are not known, but some say that their ancestors were originally found alone in the great woods standing in the shadow of the mountain Turnfjall. Legends suggest that they were children stolen from a race of even larger men and women living high in the slopes of that ancient mountain. And who were these thieves that conspired to steal the children of giants? Some believe it was the Ironwood Witches themselves.

### Children in the Woods

Though most tallfolk are born in the Risa community, a child is still occasionally found orphaned in the forests of Turnfjall. Almost always these orphans are brought to the Risa and join the clan.

### Like Giants

Most tallfolk come close to (or slightly exceed) 10 feet in height, and they weigh several hundred pounds. Strong and hardy, they are as intelligent and skilled as other raiders. Perhaps more so. Generations of feeling like they did not quite fit in with the other clans has instilled in them a fierce desire to overachieve.

### Humble and Worried

Many tallfolk, as they age, begin to hear whispers… a faceless voice whose words are never heard clearly. Yet the meaning is inescapable: the voice urges them towards violence and anger, and often towards the mountains of Turnfjall. And so, they counter-balance that with a gentleness that belies their great size.

But those that anger the tallfolk always reap consequences.

### Tallfolk Names

In general, the names are very similar to other raider names. For those that are raised on their own, or in more unusual circumstances, they may have more unique names.

**Names:** Artog, Blar, Dwat, Haw, Mon, Nock, Nuna, Rima, Rowl, Spar, Stroth.  

### Tallfolk Traits

The tallfolk have the following traits.  

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.
- **Age.** Tallfolk age slightly slower than humans, reaching adulthood in their early twenties and living a little past one hundred.
- **Size.** Tallfolk are about 7½ feet tall on average, often weighing over 300 lbs. Your size is Medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
- **Giant's Presence.** You gain an expertise die on either Athletics, Intimidation, or Nature checks.
- **Heavy Lifter.** When determining your carrying capacity and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered to be Large. (These amounts are doubled.)
- **Mighty Resistance.** You gain an expertise die on Strength saving throws and contested Strength checks.

Tallfolk may select one of the following heritage gifts in addition to the traits above.

*Earth-Child*- Brown or black skinned, these are the predominant tallfolk and are the only tallfolk most raiders have ever encountered.

- **Resist Thunder.** You have resistance to thunder damage. 
- **Rocky Flesh.** When you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take. The damage you take is reduced by 1d12 + your Constitution modifier. You must complete a short or long rest to use this trait again.

*Cold-Child*- These tallfolk have a blue tinge to their skin and tend to be slightly larger than earth-children, hinting at a different ancestry. Other tallfolk are less welcoming of cold-children and they seldom hold any important position within the Risa.

- **Resist Cold.** You have resistance to cold damage. 
- **Touch of Winter.** You know the ray of frost cantrip. You can cast burning hands once per long rest, dealing cold damage instead of fire damage. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your choice of Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

*Fire-Child*- These tallfolk have a soot grey tinge to their skin with red or orange hair and tend to be slightly stockier than earth-children, hinting at a different ancestry. Like cold-children, other tallfolk are less welcoming of fired-children and they seldom hold any important position within the Risa.
- **Resist Fire.** You have resistance to fire damage. 
- **Scorching Attack.** As a bonus action, you can boost your damage this turn with the power of fire. Creatures you deal damage to this turn take additional fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. However, the sting of your temper lessens after the first blow, so after you deal this extra damage to a creature, this trait cannot deal extra damage to it during the same combat.

At 10th level, you may also choose one of the following paragon gifts.

*Massive (requires Heavy Lifter trait and medium size)*- Have you always been this tall? Your height increases by 2 feet, and your weight increases as well. You can hold and attack with two-handed melee weapons using only one hand; such attacks deal -1 damage. If a melee weapon is neither two-handed nor versatile, you can use it as a dual-wielding weapon.  Finally, you count as large size for the purpose of what creature you can affect with combat maneuvers (including basic maneuvers) as well as what creatures can grapple you, forcibly move you, or affect you with combat maneuvers.

*Superlative Strength*- Your Strength score increases by 2. Your maximum Strength score increases by 4.

*Giantkin Scion*- The damage resistance granted by your heritage gift improves to immunity.
