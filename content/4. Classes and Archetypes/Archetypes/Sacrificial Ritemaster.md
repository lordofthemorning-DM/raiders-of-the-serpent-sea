All druids understand that life and death are both a part of the balance of the natural order, and they all have a respect for the power of the elements. But some take this further, adamantly holding to the belief that new life can only come when fed with death, that every blessing has a price. Such druids are keepers of ancient rituals and rites of sacrifice, drawing on death to heal and empower their allies. Such druids are uniquely suited to mastery of the cleansing power of fire, and in some places are known as Wicker druids after a particularly noteworthy ritual.

It should be noted, that while these druids have a perhaps deserved sinister reputation, they are not all monsters who capture and sacrifice unsuspecting victims. Some limit themselves only to the sacrificing of non-sentient life, while others are natural avengers who seek out those who have harmed the natural world or their communities, bringing them to justice while ensuring their deaths do the good their lives did not.

### Sacrificial Rites
When you select this archetype at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to mark a creature for sacrifice.  Once on your turn when you deal damage to this creature, it takes additional fire damage equal to your wisdom modifier.  When it dies, if the creature had a CR no lower than half your level, you gain a Burning Boon charge. You can only have a number of Burning Boon charges at a time equal to your proficiency bonus. You can expend a Burning Boon charge as an action to cast the *bless* spell at 1st level without expending a spell slot, and can expend additional charges to increase the effective spell slot level of bless by 1 per charge.  A *bless* spell cast using one or more Burning Boon charges does not require concentration.  You can only mark a creature in this way once per short or long rest, and lose any Burning Boon charges when you finish a long rest.

### Life and Death
At 6th level, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points you gain a death die.  Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you gain a life die.  Both of these dice start as d4s, and if you cast the appropriate type of spell while you already have one its size increases by one step, to a maximum of a d12.  When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points you can spend your life die to roll it and add it to one healing roll for the spell.  When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage you can spend your death die to roll it and add it to one damage roll for the spell.
In addition, you always have the *cauterize* spell prepared, it does not count against your number of spells prepared, and you may cast it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus without expending a spell slot.  You regain all uses of this ability when you finish a long rest.

### Regular Sacrifice
At 10th level you can expend a use of wildshape to mark a creature for sacrifice, in addition to your normal uses.

### Ultimate Sacrifice
At 14th level, you can expend 5 Burning Boon charges to cast the *resurrection* spell, no material component required.  You can only cast resurrection on a particular creature once in this way. You also do not need to concentrate on a *bless* spell cast using Burning Boon charges.<br>  You also gain the *flame strike* spell, it is always prepared, and does not count against the number of spells you have prepared.
