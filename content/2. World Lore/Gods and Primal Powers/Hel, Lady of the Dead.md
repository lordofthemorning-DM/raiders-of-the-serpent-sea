Thonir’s lover of old—Hel—resides in the Underworld. She is worshipped by few (and feared by many). Yet she is not a cruel being, Hel simply hates to see suffering. But her compassion does not mean she tries to help the living. Instead, she sees the Underworld as a refuge where none need feel pain ever again. The more that join her in the Underworld, the less suffering remains in the mortal world.
