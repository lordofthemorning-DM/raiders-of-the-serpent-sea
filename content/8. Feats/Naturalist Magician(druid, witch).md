### Naturalist Magician 
***Prerequisite:** 3 witch (green witch archetype) and 3 druid* <br>
Magic isn’t just something found in dusty libraries of arcane tomes, hallowed temples, or alien far off planes. It permeates the very earth you stand on, the air you breathe.

- If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not Wisdom, you may change it to Wisdom. 
- You may add half your witch level to your druid level for the purpose of your wildshape feature. 
- You gain the Scholar of Old Ways Natural Demeanor option if you do not already have it, or a different option if you do.

These spells count against your normal number of prepared spells and the total number of higher level spells each class may prepare is equal to your proficiency bonus. 
- You may add half your witch levels to your druid levels for the purpose of the Improved Natural Bond and Greater Natural Bond abilities. If you would gain access to one of these solely through your druid levels, you learn the rare Naturalized version of the listed summon spell, which you may use either with that ability or normal spellcasting.

- You gain the Embrace Serenity druid ability. If you already have it, you gain Embrace Ferocity instead.
