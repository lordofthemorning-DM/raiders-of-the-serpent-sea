You were part of a merchant’s caravan making its way to a bustling port in your homeland, when a multicolored portal appeared, swallowing you and the rest of your caravan. You emerged on a barren coast, a tumultuous sea to your north. Many of the caravan wagons were damaged or lost entirely, having appeared in the hostile waters. You, and the other survivors, made your way along the coastal desert, but all manner of unusual creatures assailed you. Many of your companions died and only a few of you found your way to Nowhere.

You joined this community of outcasts and are now a varang. Guided by the town’s seer, you have made a journey west, to the Tower of Kekkell, with the hope that its secrets might help you understand how to return home.
- **Player Interest**: Wizard of Oz, The Fionavar Tapestry 
- **Restrictions:** Must be an explorer from another land (unlike other backgrounds)

#### Source of Inspiration
You draw comfort from the thought of home, even when it’s hard to endure. You gain inspiration whenever you forgo a comfort or accept a significant hardship in order to better advance your journey.  You also gain inspiration anytime you complete a Heroic Task.<br>
*Willingly partake in a forced march, leave behind someone you’ve grown close to, take a shortcut through a perilous region.*

#### Inspiration Feature
Something inside you calls you on, directing you as to the best path to take. You may spend your inspiration to select a location whose existence you are aware of. The Narrator provides you with a substantial hint or bonus that will allow you to reach that destination or overcome obstacles in your way. Often, this will take the form of a Boon or Discovery or an automatic success on a journey activity (regardless of the initial roll). Likewise, you may also spend inspiration to automatically succeed against the maze spell.

#### Feature: A Newcomer’s Rune ( ᚱ ))

You have been tattooed with a traveler’s rune (ᚱ), given to you by the runethrower of the varang in Nowhere. At certain moments in the story additional runes will be drawn, adding to your story, your abilities, and helping you understand how you might return home.

  

#### Feature: Resourceful

When visiting an unfamiliar populated area, you can decide to socialize with the locals. If you make a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check at the end of six hours you can then live a modest lifestyle in that community for only 1 silver piece a day. This location becomes favorable to you as well and any Persuasion, Deception, or Insight checks are made with advantage in this community.

### Suggested Characteristics

You have a deep longing for your homeland, having either family or friends there that you miss deeply. You would do anything to return home, but you are also aware that doing so requires you to accumulate glory and wealth, so you have the means to find a way. You have also begun to make connections and attachments, likely causing a division in your loyalties.
