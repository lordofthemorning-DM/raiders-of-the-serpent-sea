Note: several maneuvers in this tradition require a character to have an unused spell slot of a certain level or a certain number of unspent spell points in order to use them.  As such, it should only be taken by characters with access to spellcasting.

### Infused Strike (2 points) 
*1st degree Cutting Omen action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 1st level or higher or at least 2 unspent spell points*<br> 
You infuse your weapon with latent magical energy and strike with it. Choose a damage type dealt by a cantrip you know or a spell you have prepared. Make a melee attack with a weapon or unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 additional damage of the chosen damage type. 

### Martial Caster Stance (1 point) 
*1st degree Cutting Omen bonus action (stance)* <br>
You steel your resolve and draw on your supernatural power, readying yourself for the battle to come. You gain an expertise die on concentration checks.

### Forceful Defense (1 point) 
*1st degree Cutting Omen reaction* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 1st level or higher or at least 2 unspent spell points* <br>
You respond to an incoming attack with a blast of magical force, driving your opponent back. When you would be hit by a melee attack, you may use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to AC against the attack. If this causes the attack to miss, at your option the creature is pushed 10 feet away from you if it is Large-sized or smaller. 

### Magical Reserves (special) 
*1st degree Cutting Omen bonus action* <br>
You draw upon the strength of your resolve to replenish your magical reserves, albeit at a cost. You may restore spell slots by spending exertion at a rate of 3 exertion points per spell-level of the slot. For example, if you wished to restore a 2nd-level spell slot this way, you would need to expend 6 exertion points. Alternatively, you can restore spell points or artifact charges, spending 3 exertion points per 2 spell points or artifact charges. You may restore any number of spell slots and spell points this way, provided you have the exertion to pay for them. The strain of this process takes a metaphysical toll. You take 1 point of necrotic damage per 3 exertion points spent on this maneuver. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.

### Accursed Strike (2 points) 
*2nd degree Cutting Omen action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 1st level or higher or at least 2 unspent spell points* <br>
You whisper fell imprecations over your weapon and ready yourself to curse your foes as you wound them. Make a melee attack with a weapon or unarmed strike. If the attack hits, the target is affected by a randomly determined effect from the table below in addition to the damage done by the attack. You are aware of which effect has affected the target.

### Transform Weapon (2 points) 
*2nd degree Cutting Omen bonus action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 1st level or higher or at least 2 unspent spell points*<br>
You transform your weapon into something more immediately useful. You transform your weapon into another weapon you are proficient with. This change lasts only until the end of your turn. If your weapon has magical properties that could apply to its new form, they are still present. Otherwise, they are suppressed. A ranged weapon such as a bow or sling does not come with ammunition; you must provide it as normal. 

### Spellcaster’s Jab (1 point) 
*2nd degree Cutting Omen bonus action* <br>
You have learned to flow straight out of the motions of a spell into a weapon attack. Use this maneuver after casting a spell with a casting time of 1 action that neither deals damage nor imposes conditions. You make a single melee weapon attack. 

### Ethereal Strike (2 points) 
*3rd degree Cutting Omen action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 2nd level or higher or at least 3 unspent spell points, spell from the movement or teleportation schools available to cast.* <br>
You vanish and reappear next to your target, catching them off guard. You teleport to an open space within 40 feet and make a single melee weapon attack with a 1d4 bonus on the attack roll. If you hit with this attack, the target is rattled until the end of its next turn. 

### Dissipating Counter (special) 
*3rd degree Cutting Omen reaction* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher or at least 5 unspent spell points, spell from the abjuration school available to cast.* <br>
You weave a quick warding symbol with your weapon, cutting hostile magic out of the air. When you are targeted by a hostile spell with a visible ray or projectile (such as scorching ray, acid arrow, or magic missile) you may spend exertion equal to 1 + the spell’s level to counter it (spending 1 exertion to counter a cantrip). This maneuver has no effect on spells with an area of effect. 

### Battle Mage Stance (1 point) 
*4th degree Cutting Omen bonus action (stance)* <br>
***Prerequisites:*** *Extra Attack* <br>
You call upon your latent magical power to infuse your weapon attacks. When you use Extra Attack, you can replace any of the weapon attacks with a weaponry cantrip. However, each cantrip cast this way beyond the first each round costs you 2 points of exertion. 

### Penetrating Strike (2 points) 
*4th degree Cutting Omen action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher or at least 5 unspent spell points, spell from the conjuration school available to cast.*<br>
You call upon your magical abilities to pass through an enemy’s defenses as if they were not there. You make a single weapon attack against a target, with a +20 bonus to hit. This attack requires such intense focus that it cannot be augmented via other means such as a herald’s Divine Smite, a rogue's Sneak Attack, or any other spell or effect that would add additional effects to the attack. The attack cannot land a critical hit.

### Willful Resilience (3 points) 
*5th degree Cutting Omen bonus action* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 3rd level or higher or at least 5 unspent spell points , spell from the abjuration school available to cast.* <br>
You summon your will to purge harmful effects from yourself. You end a single condition affecting you from the following list: blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, rattled, restrained, slowed, stunned, or unconscious (provided you have at least 1 hit point). Even if the condition would normally prevent you from taking actions (such as being stunned, paralyzed, or unconscious), you may use this maneuver, but the exception from this maneuver does not extend to any other capabilities you possess. Alternatively, you may choose to end the effect of a spell affecting you if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or lower. 

### Absorb Energy (3 points) 
*5th degree Cutting Omen reaction* <br>
***Requirement:*** *Unused spell slot of 4th level or higher or at least 6 unspent spell points, spell from the abjuration school available to cast.* <br>
You can absorb some of the magical energy of spells cast on you for your own purposes. Use this maneuver when you become the sole target of a spell. You recover a spell slot or number of spell points equal to half the minimum which is necessary to cast the spell, rounded down. For example, if you were hit with an acid arrow you could use this maneuver to recover a 1st-level spell slot or 1 spell point. If a cure wounds spell was cast on you with a 5th-level spell slot, you could recover 1 spell point (but not a spell slot). If you already have your full allotment of spell slots for the given level or if your spell points are at their maximum, any excess is lost. The triggering spell otherwise affects you as normal. You may not absorb energy from spells you cast on yourself.
