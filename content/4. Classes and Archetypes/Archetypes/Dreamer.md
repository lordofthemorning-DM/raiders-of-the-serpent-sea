In the traditions of many worlds, there is a belief in an early, primeval, state of the world. It is a belief that beings from this long ago can be harnessed, bargained with, or exploited by powerful spellcasters with varying degrees of success... and often tragic results. To this day some raider witches still seek out the primal path, believing it alone might hold the secret to preventing what befell the Lost Lands from afflicting Grimnir. These are known as dreamers. 

Among every clan there might be witches of this type, though dreamers often hide their true nature. Not that it matters, for most raiders dislike any and all arcane casters, due to their association with the magic of [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]]. Owing to this, most raider witches (and wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks) are isolated and surly. Outside of the training of their apprentices, they only meet their peers at the octennial gathering of the clans. Otherwise, they seldom interact, except to battle one another.

### Primal Magic
You are a dreamer trying to connect with the secret arcane mysteries of the world. These individuals seek to unravel all the primal mysteries of Grimnir, following in the path set by Mirgal but avoiding his mistakes. Dreamers read everything they find and will go to great lengths—and risk—to uncover any ruins or artifacts from the long ago.
You gain proficiency with light armor. 
Your connection with the primal allows you to anticipate what may unfold for you on any given day, affording you more flexibility than other witches. As a bonus action you may swap a prepared spell for any other spell of the same level or lower on your spell list. You may do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You must then finish a long rest to use this feature again.


### Foresaying
Those that study the primal have a way of seeing the connections between the past and the future, or between individuals. These connections are imagined as knotted cords and with experience, a primal witch can see and understand many such connections and use this knowledge to further their own actions. At 6th level, you become able to influence the future, based on your understanding of the past.
If you spend 1 minute, you may cast any spell that targets only yourself, but save its activation for later. After having used this Foresaying ability, you may activate that spell at any time, as a bonus action.  You may only have one Foresaying spell active at a time and may only use your Foresaying ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. After that you must finish a long rest to use this feature again. If you have not cast your Foresaying spell when you take a long rest, it is lost.

### Farsight Foresaying
At 10th level, your knowledge of the knotted cords has increased, better preparing you to weather the hazards of Grimnir.
When you cast your Foresaying spell, roll a d6. A result of 6 means that the Foresaying spell is not expended and can be triggered again later.

### Puller of Cords
By 14th level, dreamers have gained tremendous expertise that serves them well, especially in trials of arcane combat. 
You have become very proficient at working your way through the fate cords affecting you. When you fail a concentration check you may use your reaction to immediately cast another spell that requires concentration. You must have a valid spell available to cast and its normal casting time must be no longer than one action. If these conditions are met, you automatically succeed with the concentration check and are now maintaining both spells. Subsequent concentration checks are made with disadvantage while you are concentrating on both spells. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
