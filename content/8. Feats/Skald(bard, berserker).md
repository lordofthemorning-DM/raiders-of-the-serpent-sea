### Skald
***Prerequisites:*** *3 levels in berserker, 3 levels in bard (Warchanter or Seer archetype)* <br>
Skalds are the keepers of history among warrior peoples, the tellers of tales and singers of songs who compose and recite epic poems and sagas about the great and grand deeds of their people. But far more than mere spectators or historians, their works are infused with the grit of experience, and as a result their art burns with the same passion as the rage that takes them when battle is joined, striding into the front lines weapon in hand as they gain first hand accounts of the tales they tell. You gain the following benefits:
- You may concentrate on battle hymns while raging.
- If you affect an ally with a battle hymn or grant them bardic inspiration while raging, the recipient also gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your bardic inspiration die + the amount of rage hit points you gain each round.  If such an affect would already grant temporary hit points (such as the Harmony of Pain battle hymn), this amount is added to that total.
- You gain an expertise die on history and culture checks and may always choose to use your Constitution or charisma modifier on such checks.

### Music of Battle
***Prerequisites:*** *Skald feat*<br>
When using the Voice art specialty as your spell focus, you can expend a bardic inspiration die when you start a rage. You can cast bard spells during that rage, but the total number of spell levels you can cast over the course of that particular rage cannot exceed maximum value of your bardic inspiration die (6 for a d6, 8 for a d8, etc.)  You still cannot concentrate on spells, nor may you cast non-bard spells.

### Singer of Songs, Doer of Deeds
***Prerequisites:*** *Music of Battle feat* 
You learn the Sing as you Slay additional battle hymn:<br>
#### Sing as you Slay. 
You can target a number of allied creatures with this battle hymn equal to your charisma modifier and may not target yourself. An allied creature has a critical hit range with melee weapon attacks equal to that granted by your crushing blows ability. If they already have an equal or greater critical hit range with melee weapon attacks, they instead increase their critical hit range by 1 to a maximum of 17-20. When a creature under the effects of this battle hymn critically hits with a melee weapon, they may apply one of your Furious Critical effects. If you start your turn raging, you may sustain this battle hymn without expending any additional uses of Bardic Inspiration.<br>
In addition, if you critically hit with a melee weapon attack while raging, you regain an expended use of bardic inspiration.
