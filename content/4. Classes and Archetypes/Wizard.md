House Rules
### Primal Ink
Writing is an uncommon practice for raiders and they often rely on oral traditions to pass knowledge from one generation to another. Wizards are among the few groups that use writing daily but given the limited access to writing material, primal wizards chose to ink their magic onto their very flesh.
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you are considered proficient with the art of tattooing. Primarily you use this ability to scribe your spells into your flesh. To copy a new spell as a tattoo requires twice the time of copying a spell into a standard spellbook but half the cost.
During a long rest, your known spells swim across your skin, like auroras, allowing you to select which should be prepared. Once you have made your choices, the tattoos settle into runes of any color you prefer, and any spells not chosen for preparation withdraw deep into your flesh. The magical nature of the tattoos prevents them from being harmed, no matter the danger that befalls you.
If you tattoo your spells in this way, you may also have them function as a focus tattoo to use a s a spellcasting focus, though you must attune to them as normal to do so.  You can cast spells tattooed onto yourself with a different type of spellcasting focus without attunement as normal.

The following additional Elective Studies are allowed:

### ASTUTE ASTROLOGER 
You are a careful student of the skies. You gain proficiency with navigator’s tools, or if you are already proficient, an expertise die on checks made using them. In addition, you always know which way is north and how long it will be before the next sunset or sunrise. 
### COMPONENT COLLECTOR 
You have a nose for finding spell components. You have advantage on checks made to use the Gather Components journey activity. On a success, you also find additional components worth an amount of gold equal to you Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), or twice that amount on a critical success. 
### CURIOUS CORRESPONDENT 
*Prerequisites: able to cast find familiar* 
When you cast *find familiar*, the range at which you can communicate with your familiar and use its senses instead of your own becomes unlimited. While you are using your familiar’s senses, you may also speak through your familiar, causing them to replicate the sound of your voice exactly. 
### EAGER PUPIL 
You are quick of study and always on the lookout for new teachers. You require only half the usual gold and time to perform the Research downtime activity. In addition, after speaking with a person for at least 1 minute, you can use an action to make either an Insight or Arcana check against their passive Deception. On a success, you learn the following information about them: 
- Whether they have a higher Intelligence score than yourself. 
- Which lore skills (Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, and Religion) they are proficient in, if any. 
- Whether they have class levels in the warlock or wizard classes
### POINTY HAT AND FLOWING ROBE 
You are an authority in matters of magic, and your bearing and accouterments communicate that fact to great effect. While your identity is not concealed, you gain an expertise die on Persuasion and Intimidation checks against creatures who cannot cast spells or whose maximum spell level is no higher than half of yours (rounded up). 
### RIDDLESPEAK 
You gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks made to solve riddles and puzzles. In addition, you can easily avoid speaking directly by cloaking your meaning in wordplay and allusions, allowing you to hide a short message within other speech or writing. Most creatures will take your words at face value, but suspicious creatures may make an Intelligence (Insight) check against your spell save DC to notice that you have hidden a message in your words. On a success of 5 or more, they also learn your hidden meaning. When you use this ability, you may include specific tells and points of reference in your riddlespeak to allow creatures you choose and with whom you are familiar to automatically succeed on the check.

Whenever you cast *comprehend languages*, the range at which you can understand written languages extends to 60 feet, you can read 10 times faster than you would normally be able to, and you gain an expertise die on Insight checks made to understand and interpret written information. These benefits last for the duration of the spell.
