The Knattle inhabit some of the coldest, and most extreme, regions of Grimnir. There is sparse lumber for the building of their ships so they tend to rely more on the materials they can extract from the great riverwhales they hunt. The Long Winter has proven less onerous to them as they have long familiarity with surviving harsh winters.

The Knattle compete rigorously and often, from contests of strength or agility, to boardgames carved from tusk and played in their whalebone homes throughout the long dark. Their leader, Hroarr, is a tall dwarf, five feet in height. Hroarr proved himself through numerous contests and unlike some dwarves, has no aversion to travel by longship. He became a skilled—and feared—raid leader defending the long coasts the Knattle hold.

In the great reckoning that followed the previous clan leader’s death, Hroarr bested all contenders to become jarl. But his hold over the clan is tenuous for many do not want a dwarf leading them. 

- Jarl: Hroarr Longspear
- Heritages: Humans; Dwarves
- Settlements: Tukk, their primary settlement, is in the High North. They also have smaller fishing posts along that northern coast and a few camps on Turnfjall as well.![[Knattle.jpg]]
