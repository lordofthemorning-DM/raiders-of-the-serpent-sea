### Witch-Knight 
***Prerequisite:** 3 witch and 3 herald* <br>
Not all witches confine themselves to magic alone.

You gain the following benefits:

- If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not charisma, you may change it to charisma. 
- You gain proficiency with the [[Cutting Omen]] combat tradition. 
- You gain the Hands of Healing magical mystery if you do not already have it. If you do, you may choose a Magical Mystery or Divine Lesson of your choice. The points from this pool and your Lay on Hands pool are combined together. 
- Anytime you gain a divine lesson or magical mystery, you may gain one of the other instead, and may add your herald and witch levels together for the purpose of qualify for them.

***Prerequisite**: Witch-Knight feat* <br>
You are particularly adept in using magic to alter and empower your divine smites, gaining the following benefits:

- You may apply an Empowered Smite effect to a divine smite even if you do not have that ability by expending a spell of first level or higher. 
- You also gain the following additional empowered smite options: 
	- Bewitching Smite- Your smite instead deals psychic damage, and on hit the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute. This ends early if you or an ally deals damage to them. 
	- Bewildering Smite- Your smite instead deals psychic damage, and on hit the target must make a Charisma saving throw or be confused for 1 minute. They may repeat this save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. 
	- Withering Smite- Your smite instead deals necrotic damage, and on hit the target must make a Constitution saving throw or have its hit points maximum reduced by the damage of the smite. 

### Oath of Magic 
***Prerequisite:** Mystic Smite feat* <br>
You have come to fully embody your mystical oath, and for your dedication magic answers your call. You gain the following additional benefits: 
- You may prepare witch or herald spells of any level you have spell slots for, even if they are higher spell level than your current level allows as long as they are of a level the class preparing them could potentially cast. Such higher level spells must be from your herald archetype bonus spell school(s), your witch's magic bonus spell schools, or any bonus spell schools or individual bonus spells from your witch archetype. A class may still only prepare spells from its own list. 
- You may add half your witch levels to your herald level for the purpose of what spell slots you may use to gain a temporary exertion pool.
