Trickster priests are clerics of duplicitous nature.  Some devote themselves to clandestine or secret organizations within more traditional faiths, others are devoted to gods or faiths of trickery and subversion acting as cosmic gestures seeking to pants powers both light and dark in service of the true absurdity of the cosmos, while more villainous examples act as impersonators, stealing the devotion of adherents of other faiths often for selfish ends while drawing their true strength from more nefarious powers.  On Grimnir, such priests often draw their power from vestiges of the betrayer Mirgal.

### Undermining Skills
At 1st level you gain proficiency with one of the following skills: Stealth, Deception, or Sleight of Hand.

In addition, you learn the *minor illusion* and *message* cantrips.  When using *message*, you may disguise your voice so that the recipient doesn't know it is you talking.  Starting at level 8, you may have your message impersonate the voice of another person you have heard.

### Channel Divinity: Trickster's Guile
At 2nd level you may expend your Channel Divinity when you fail an ability check.  You may re-roll that check and gain an expertise die on the re-roll. You must take the new result.<br>
Alternatively, at 2nd level you may choose a channel divinity option from another cleric archetype that is granted at 2nd level in place of the above option.  You gain that channel divinity option instead.  Once this choice has been made it cannot be changed.

### Deceptive Duplicate
At 6th level as a bonus action you can summon an identical duplicate of yourself within 30 feet.  This duplicate lasts for 1 minute.  You can cast spells as if they originated from the duplicate's space, though you must still see the target if necessary.  As a bonus action you can move the duplicate up to 30 feet, and as an action you can swap places with the duplicate.  Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
