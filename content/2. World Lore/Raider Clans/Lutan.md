Clan Lutan is also one of the original clans, but the Lutans themselves have never exerted as much influence as either the Tvar or the Hallharn (much to the annoyance of their past and current jarls). They have always strived for more prestige and glory but often find themselves on theÂ wrong side of conflicts. They worship [[Luta, The Goddess of Will|Luta]].

- Jarl: Kare Branaskr
- Heritages: Humans; Black, Blue, and Green Dragonborn
- Settlements: At any time, they have two or three smaller settlements in addition to their primary village, Tunn-Arg, but these settlements often move location because the Lutans are mostly nomadic.![[Lutan.jpg]]
