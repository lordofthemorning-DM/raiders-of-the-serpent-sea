title: Raiders of the Serpent Sea
---
Welcome. This site is a repository of the player information you will need for the Roll them Bones campaign of Raiders of the Serpent Sea.  Lore, house rules, character options, all available here.  Options that are available on the A5e.tools site that are being used as written are presented via links to save time.  Any option that I have tweaked or house ruled or that is from a third party source not on that site (including options form the campaign) are reproduced here in their entirety.

# General notes
- I have carefully curated the list of available options in order to properly capture the feel of a Viking/Norse mythology themed campaign.  If you have another option you really want to play you can ask, but the answer is probably going to be no.
- There is a fair amount of 3rd party stuff here.  A lot of it I have either contributed to or played with before, but not all of it.  I reserve the right to tweak or remove a particular option if it proves unbalanced (this is most likely to be the case with spells, and I do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of all available spells for the game beyond the core rules).
- This game will be using [[1. Level Up|Level Up]] Advanced 5th Edition. See the relevant page for details.
- Finally, a PDF will be made available for Spells from the Forgotten Vault, a 3rd party supplement adding additional spells, since the alternative would be copy and pasting almost 50 pages worth of pdf into this site which just isn't worth it.  The same is true for the new spell section for Manual of Adventurous Resources: Complete. More details on the Spells page.
