They say that someone whose name is still spoken is not dead, and you aim to achieve immortality by that road. The great driving force in your life is a desire to create something that outlasts you, that marks the world for many years after you have left it—and perhaps even changes its destiny forever. 

#### Source of Inspiration: Building Blocks. 
You draw inspiration from progressing toward some great overarching goal or by building up a body of work that can outlast you. 
*Have some work recognized as exceptional in your lifetime, convince a large number of people to support a cause you believe in, discover or invent something with wide-ranging implications, undermine long-standing physical or social structures.* 

#### Inspiration Feature: Dogged Persistence. 
Those who give up rarely change the world. You may spend inspiration to do one of the following (no action required): 
- Minimize the damage you take from a single attack or other source (such as a fall, spell, or environmental effect) this turn. 
- Treat a long rest you take outside of a haven as if it had been taken inside a haven. 
- Reroll an unsuccessful ability check, taking the new roll if it is better. 
- Restore a spent hit die. 

#### Fulfilling Your Destiny 
You fulfill your destiny of Legacy when you create something that will last far beyond your time. Invent something that changes daily life for a whole society or a whole world, create a great work that will be presented as a masterpiece for centuries to come, change the structure of a society, change the relationship between two societies dramatically, cure or introduce a widespread affliction. 
*Fulfillment Feature: Changed the World.* You are known far and wide. Your glory increases by 3. If your glory is ever 7 or lower, it is instead increased to 8.
