Once the handsomest of all Vanir, this elven cleric wore fine armor and wielded an elaborately carved mace. A helmet with eagle wings fanning out from it always adorned his head. A ferocious Yoten in wolf form felled him during the Exodus but he was dragged by Vani and Luta to safety. Healers saved him but he remained badly scarred, especially across the face and chest. Yet, the stories say, he lost none of his charm, kindness, or presence.
