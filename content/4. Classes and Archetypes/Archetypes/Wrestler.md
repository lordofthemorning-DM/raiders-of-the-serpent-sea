Wrestlers are those adepts that have fully specialized in the grappling arts. They know how to various locks, holds, and the leverage and the body weight of themselves and their opponents to both lockdown and restrain targets.  They can even grapple creatures that normal warriors would be incapable of, performing near superhuman feats.

### Mastery of Fundamentals
When you select this archetype at 3rd level basic melee damage you deal is equal to your unarmed strike damage.  This stacks with the Total Combat focus feature if you later take that. You can use the grapple basic maneuver with in place of your bonus action martial arts attack, or one or more flurry of blows attacks.

### All in the Leverage
At 6th level your speed is no longer halved when moving a grappled creature of your size or smaller, and you can grapple creatures up to two size categories larger than you, though they have advantage on the save.

### Headlock
At 11th level when you successfully grapple a creature of your size or smaller, you can spend an exertion point to restrain them for the duration of the grapple.

### Body Blow
At 17th level when you have a creature of your size or smaller grappled, you can use them to attack another creature within your reach with an improvised melee weapon attack, dealing basic melee damage to both them and the target on hit.  You can instead spend an exertion point to throw them as a ranged improvised weapon, range 10/20 feet, in which case both creatures take basic melee damage if you hit, only the thrown creature takes basic melee damage if you miss, and the grapple then ends.  You can use this to throw a grappled creature up to 20 feet even if you don't have a target to attack, dealing basic melee damage to the thrown creature as if you had missed.
