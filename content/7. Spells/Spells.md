Spells are the one major exception to my "reproducer what you need on this site" approach.  There are, frankly, too many of them for that.  I am currently allowing all spells on the tools site, as well as those from Spells from the Forgotten Vault and Manual of Adventurous Resources Complete.  PDFs of the former and the relevant sections of the latter can be found in the following google drive folder: 

I have not necessarily kept up to date on all of the spells published for the game, particularly those form the official EnPublishing magazine the Gatepass Gazette.  As such if you come across a spell I am not familiar with and it winds up being wildly overpowered or otherwise broken, I reserve the right to ban or alter it.

You will notice that in addition to the 8 classical spell schools, spells in level up have one or more secondary schools.  This mechanic is mostly relevant to the Herald and Witch classes, though certain other archetypes or abilities also reference them.

Below you will find the new spells from the Raiders of the Serpent Sea campaign, which I have reproduced here, partly because they are small in number and partly to add relevant A5e information like secondary spell schools.

### Arcane Evasion 
*2nd-level (illusion; protection, obscurement)* <br>
**Classes:** sorcerer, warlock, witch, wizard<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action <br>
**Range:** Self Components: V, S, M (sand)<br>
**Duration:** 1 minute <br>
Once cast, enemy spellcasters perceive only a distorted version of you, your form wavering and ever changing. While this spell is active any ranged or melee spell attack targeting you has disadvantage. 

### Bloodsharing 
*3rd-level (necromancy; healing, necrotic)* <br>
**Classes:** cleric, druid, witch<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 action <br>
**Range:** self<br>
**Area:** 10 ft<br>
**Area Shape**: circle<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (a knife and the blood of the participants) <br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes <br>
You slice a knife into your flesh (inflicting 1 slashing damage) and murmur ancient words in a language no longer remembered. Each participant within the area who uses their reaction to also cut their own flesh (and whom you accept into the spell) becomes part of the bloodsharing for the remaining duration. Until the spell ends, any magical healing that affects one of the bloodsharers, affects all of them. 

### Cry of the Wild 
*4th-level (enchantment; communication, enhancement, nature)* <br>
**Classes:** druid<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 action Range: 20 feet <br>
**Components:** V <br>
**Duration:** 1 day <br>
With a gesture and a kind word you strengthen your bond with your animal friends. Any friendly beasts within the area of effect gain +4 to their Armor Class. If an affected creature sees or hears any other creature, it telepathically alerts the caster (if within 120 feet of the caster). Finally, each creature may also be given a message to deliver to another creature that it or the caster has previously met—it will travel up to a day’s journey to repeat that message to the target (telepathically).

### Fair Play 
*2nd-level (abjuration)* <br>
**Classes:** bard, herald, sorcerer, warlock, witch, wizard<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 action <br>
**Range:** Short (30 feet) <br>
**Target:** One creature<br>
**Components:** V, S <br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute <br>
A creature of your choice within range gains a benefit when fighting larger creatures. Whenever they make an attack roll or skill check against a creature that is one size or more larger than themselves, they have advantage on the roll. <br>
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. 

### Fortune’s Form 
*6th-level (divination; nature, senses)*<br>
**Classes:** druid, witch<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 minute <br>
**Range:** Self <br>
**Components**: V, S, M (eye of a beast) <br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours <br>
For one hour you create and mentally control a fylgja—a supernatural creature that represents you at a primal level. The first time you cast this spell you declare what your fylgja is—any beast; large size or smaller. From then on, any time you cast this spell, this is your fylgja. <br>
Your fylgja form is invisible and can move through any surface no thicker than 10 feet. All fylgja may also fly (hover) at their current walking or flying speed (whichever is higher). It is immune to all conditions except Invisible or Frightened. Your fylgja form may only be damaged by magical attacks and spells. If it is damaged, you may choose to take the damage instead. <br>
There are several additional benefits of the form. <br>
While in your fylgja form if you see any Humanoid, you also see its fylgja floating beside it. This provides insight into the target’s personality and alignment. And, at any point in the future, if you battle a foe for whom you know their fylgja, you have advantage on all attack actions and saving throw rolls against that opponent. 
As well, you may use a bonus action to make your fylgja use one of its physical attacks (unarmed strike, bite, claw, or tail). The attack is made with your spell modifier to hit and delivers the damage in the stat block for that creature, but it is delivered as force damage and no additional effects (such as poison damage or conditions such as grappled) are delivered to the target. The fylgja remains invisible if its attack misses or does not cause damage. However, the spell immediately ends if the attack does deliver damage to the target. <br>
Finally, you use a bonus action to swap locations with the fylgja as if you both teleported (any spell that prevents teleportation prevents the use of this effect). <br>
If at any time, and for any reason, the spell ends, the fylgja disappears and you are teleported to your original location. If your fylgja is more than 1 mile away from you when the spell ends, you take 6d8 psychic damage. Forms of the Fylgja The game master has a table to help them determine the fylgja forms of NPCs.

**Components:** V, S, M (skull of a previously defeated foe) <br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute <br>
A chill wind descends as you manifest a 30-foot-radius aura. This aura clings to you and any creature other than you in the area of effect cannot benefit from non-magical or magical healing. If a creature's hit points would be healed by any means (including regeneration) while in this area of effect, you gain the benefits of that healing instead. as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points are lost when this spell ends. Some battles are simply meant to end… one way or the other.

As well, if they fail, they suffer 8d6 force damage from the abrupt change. Not all shapechangers are affected: if the creature normally takes more than 10 minutes to change their shape, they merely take the damage but retain their existing form.

Exploding rings hit all opponents within 5 feet of the ring. Each ring delivers 1d8 force damage plus an additional 1d8 force damage per ring equipped by the caster. <br>
