The following additional Soldiering Knacks are allowed:

### BUILT IN A DAY 
You gain proficiency with carpenter's tools, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. With the appropriate tools and access to raw materials, you can quickly construct simple wooden structures, such as a log bridge, barricade, or perch. A Medium structure takes you 10 minutes to build, a Large structure takes 1 hour, and a Huge structure takes 8 hours. These structures are crude and improvised, and fall into disrepair and become unusable after 24 hours unless you spend an equal amount of time again to maintain them each day. 
### COMMANDO 
You gain proficiency with a sewing kit, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. By spending 1 hour (which may be part of a short or long rest) with a suit of bone, cloth, hide, or leather armor, you may give it the camouflaged property for a particular type of terrain. This modification lasts for 1 week unless you spend another hour to replace or reinforce the modification, which resets the remaining time. 
### DEFENSIVE DRIVER 
You gain proficiency with a type of vehicle, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. You may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed ability check related to vehicular activity, such as tool checks to repair a vehicle, Acrobatics checks to keep balance on a moving vehicle, or Animal Handling checks to calm animals drawing a vehicle. Likewise, if you are piloting a vehicle, you may spend 2 exertion to reroll a saving throw made by the vehicle. In both cases, you may choose whether to use the new roll or the original. 
### DRILL THE RECRUITS 
You can spend 10 minutes instructing another creature in the use of a tool or skill you have proficiency with to give them proficiency on the next check they make using that tool or skill within the next hour. Alternatively, you can simultaneously give this instruction to a number of creatures no more than twice your proficiency bonus, in which case they all gain proficiency on the next group check they make using that tool or skill within the next hour. Once a creature benefits from this bonus, it cannot do so again until it completes a short or long rest.
### FRATERNIZE 
You gain proficiency in Culture, or an expertise die if you are already proficient. If you spend 1 hour in a given community (such as a small town, noble’s court, or criminal underworld) listening, talking and getting to know people, you learn the prevailing feelings and major happenings in the community, including any important recent or upcoming events, common gossip, important figures and rivalries, and general attitudes of the members. At the Narrator's discretion, you may receive more or less information depending on how the inhabitants of the settlement perceive you. 
### IF ALL YOU HAVE IS A HAMMER 
You may spend 1 exertion to make a weapon attack roll with an appropriate weapon in place of an Athletics, Engineering, Sleight of Hand, or tool check where you could apply a weapon. Examples include prying a door open with a sword, shoring up a tunnel with a spear, swiping a pouch with a rapier, or picking a lock with a dagger. 
### INSTRUMENTS OF WAR 
You gain proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice. You can use a musical instrument you are proficient with to send signals and communicate information to your allies up to one mile away, allowing you to convey basic concepts such as “enemies on the move,” “rally to me,” and “the situation is lost.” Your allies automatically understand the meaning you’re trying to convey. When you hear similar calls and alarms from others, you always understand the meaning of the call, regardless of whether they are your allies or not. 
### TUNNEL RAT 
You are very adept at digging and tunneling. While wielding a shovel, you can dig a 5-foot by 5-foot wide tunnel through non-magical sand, loose earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow (but not solid rock) at a speed of 5 feet every 15 minutes, which includes the time taken to shore up the tunnel and add support. You can dig pits and trenches open to the air at twice this speed. In addition, you may ignore the effects of roughing it due to environmental conditions while resting in a trench or hole.
