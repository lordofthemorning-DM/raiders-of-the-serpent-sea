Your patron is a powerful ironheart tree, a patriarch or matriarch of one of the great Ironwood forests. These trees originated from the old world, the Lost Lands. Their motives are unknown, not even to those who claim to have much knowledge of them. Regardless, and for better or worse, you have aligned yourself with them.

Perhaps you were stranded, lost, or otherwise abandoned in such a forest. Or you may have sought them out intentionally, eager to wield their ancient powers. Regardless, you have sworn yourself into the service of the Ironwood.

It is yet to be determined what this means for you—and for Grimnir.

Ironwood Blessing
At 1st level, your patron gifts you with a heartseed. It is a Tiny object and may be used as your spellcasting focus for warlock spells. If the seed is destroyed or lost, you may perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement.  Choose one of the following benefits: 
#### Vitality of the Ironwood
While you are touching the heartseed you may use a bonus action to imbue yourself with the Vitality of the Ironwood.  For 10 minutes you gain temporary hit points equal to 3 x your warlock level and your movement speed is increased by 5. The effects of this feature do not stack; if Vitality of the Ironwood is used while already active, the previous temporary hit points and movement speed increase end. This feature may be used a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.
#### Curse of the Ironwood
You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you or the target dies, if you are incapacitated , or if you use another bonus action to end the curse. The curse has the following effects:
- When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.
- Once per turn when you deal your curse damage to a creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.  These temporary hit points disappear at the start of your next turn.
Once you have used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

### Armor of the Ironwood
Starting at 6th level, during a short rest you may grow a suit of armor from your heartseed. Only you may wear the armor and it lasts until you decide to grow a different suit. While wearing your Ironwood Armor your AC equals 10 + Dexterity modifier + Charisma modifier. You may still use a shield while wearing this armor.
The armor grown is one of the following (your choice):
- **Mantle of Leaves.** You have advantage when making Stealth checks. While either your Vitality of the Ironwood feature or temporary hit points from your Curse of Ironwood are active you gain another 5 feet of movement.
- **Unbreakable Branches.** You have disadvantage on Stealth checks. While either your Vitality of the Ironwood feature or temporary hit points from your Curse of Ironwood are active you are immune to critical hits.
The heartseed can still be used as a spellcasting focus while transformed in this way.

### Heart of the Ironwood
Starting at 10th level, while wearing your Armor of the Ironwood, you now have resistance to bludgeoning damage from non-magical/silvered weapons.
Additionally, you may use 10 feet of movement to magically enter a tree within your reach. You know the location of all trees within 500 feet of you and their type. You must exit from one of these trees and will appear within 5 feet of it. If you enter a tree with an intelligence score you roll a number of d6 equal to your proficiency bonus. Your hit points are restored by this amount. If you enter any other type of tree, it explodes in a 15-foot radius. All creatures of your choosing in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw. They suffer 17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed saved, half that amount on a successful save. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Colossus of the Ironwood
Starting at 14th level, you are able to enhance your Armor of the Ironwood, becoming a juggernaut of destruction. You may use an action to trigger the transformation: your armor rapidly expands in size with numerous roots and limbs erupting from it. Upon doing so, everyone of your choosing within 15 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage. The damage is halved on a successful saving throw.
While in this form you retain all your existing abilities (you can still cast spells and use weapons) and you also have the following traits:
- **Tree Slam.** You use the branches extending from you to make an unarmed strike. You use your spell attack modifier to hit, it delivers bludgeoning damage equal to 17 (5d6) + your Strength modifier + your Charisma modifier. This attack is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
- **Larger Size.** You count as Large size when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. You also add 10 feet to your walking speed, 5 feet to your reach, and inflict double damage to objects and structures.
- **Protected.** You gain 140 ironwood hit points. Unlike temporary hit points, these hit points can be restored with healing. If these ironwood hit points are reduced to zero this feature ends early and any excess damage carries over to your normal hit points.
- **Resolute.** You add your Charisma modifier to all Strength saving throws. You gain resistance to piercing damage and vulnerability to fire damage.
- **Ironwood Shell.** As an action you become a wall of branches, protecting yourself and others. While active, you add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class, you cannot be knocked prone, and you have no movement. Any ally within 5 feet gains half cover. You may end the Ironwood Shell by using a bonus action.
Unless it ends early, with an action or by other means, this feature lasts for 10 minutes. You must finish a long rest to use this feature again.


Additional archetype specific Eldritch Invocation:

### Ironwood Hardiness
*Prerequisites: Ironwood Touched archetype, level 7*
While your Armor of Ironwood is active, you have an expertise die on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.  You also have an expertise die on saving throws against effects that deal fire damage, which potentially stacks with the previous.
