Standard Rules for planetouched in A5e can be found here: https://a5e.tools/rules/planetouched

Normally planetouched come in two varieties: Aasimar and Tieflings.  I run them slightly differently: the Aasimar and Tiefling gifts are renamed *Radiant* and *Fire* respectively, and the heritage is expanded to include Genasi/Elementkin. A planetouched in this campaign can use any gift and choose celestial, infernal, primordial, or abyssal as their language regardless of gift.  In Grimnir, no distinction is made between aasimar and tieflings, and all planetouched are generally called tieflings.  They also have a much wider range of possible appearances, form the relatively subtle to the much more pronounced, and do not have to follow the standard "horn and tail" look that 5e settled on.

In addition, the following gifts are allowed:

_Water-_ You gain your choice of acid or cold resistance, 30ft swim speed, can breath air and water, and at level 3 can cast *create or destroy water* once per long rest without material components using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier.

_Earth_- Your armor class is equal to 13+Dexterity modifier when not wearing armor, can move through non-magical difficult terrain made of earth without expending additional movement.  You also know the *resistance* cantrip.

_AirÂ­_- You gain your choice of lightning or thunder resistance. You also know the *gust* cantrip, at level 3 may cast the *fog cloud* spell once per long rest, and at level 5 may cast the *gust of wind* spell once per long rest, both without material components using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier.

_Necrotic_- You gain necrotic resistance. You also know the *chill touch* cantrip, at level 3 can cast the *inflict wounds* spell once per long rest, at level 5 may cast the *ray of enfeeblement* spell once per long rest, both without material components using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier.

The following Paragon gifts are also added or altered:

*Ancestral Resistance*- *Water*, *Air*, and *Necrotic* grant immunity to the damage type they are otherwise resistant to while Earth gives a permanent +1 bonus to AC (whether wearing armor or not).

_Necrotic Assault, Watery Assault,_ and _Air Assault_ ignore resistance on targets to that damage type (your chosen damage type for Air and Water), and treat immunity on targets as resistance.

_Earth Assault_ gives you unarmed strikes that deal 1d6+strength modifier bludgeoning damage, and you deal double damage to objects and structures.

If you choose an Assault paragon gift, it must match the element of your standard gift.
