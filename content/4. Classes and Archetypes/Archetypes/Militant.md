Militants are perhaps the purest example of a fighter’s art. Rather than training toward a specific set of weapons and armor, a militant trains with them all regularly, ensuring that they will be able to fight effectively in any circumstance with whatever is at hand. Militants are often found in mercenary companies where they might be standing on the front lines of a massed battle with banners snapping overhead one day and engaged in dirty back-alley violence the next. Others may be elite royal guards, and some are merely dabblers that ultimately decided to make their lack of focus an asset.

Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
