Grimnir is vibrant, powerful, and ever changing. It is a world that thrives on action, boldness, tragedy, and impossible acts. In the early years, some who knew [[Mirgal, the Betrayer|Mirgal]] well—such as [[Aldyhn, The Goddess of Wisdom|Aldyhn]]—saw his devious mind, his love of a good story, and his bitter sense of humor in the landscapes and creatures of the world. Though his life was sacrificed, his soul is very much a part of Grimnir.

### The Primal Powers
Several beings are tied directly to Grimnir’s creation and its early development. They are not gods but are important, nonetheless.

| The Rainbow Spear<br>On an island in the center of a lake stand the statues of the gods, as well as an altar. The altar is the anchor for the Rainbow Spear, which the gods built into the earth to keep it from being moved from the location. The spear can only be activated at this location, but without its missing pieces, it behaves erratically and cannot truly be controlled. |

The people of Grimnir worship the Vanir and their offspring as gods. Though divine, they are currently trapped as living statues and unable to directly interfere with the world; they may only influence it. Most raiders have an effigy of at least one of these Stone Court gods, woven from cloth or wool, that sits near their hearth. When traveling, the family take the effigy with them, believing it allows their favored god to intervene on their behalf when needed.

  
The Stone Court itself sits on top of Turnfjall. The area consists of a massive lake that, since the gods’ misfortune, has become rumored as a home for numerous monsters, discouraging exploration. Only a few raider expeditions have been sent to find it in the past few generations. None have returned.

## The Afterlife

#### The Dead That Burn
To die with a weapon in hand is the near zealous goal of every proud raider. It is known that those that are battle slain, and then offered to the night sky with the burning of a pyre, will be taken to the Halls of the Slain. It is said that the valkry themselves see the column of corpse smoke and they rush from the heavens to latch upon the dead hero and ascend with them. All raiders dream of this moment, and of their afterlife in the halls, where they feast and battle one another till the day Ragnarök arrives and they return to fight alongside their living descendants against the forces of ruin.

The raiders know this to be true for many have seen valkry (either on the field of battle or during the great funerals) escort a comrade into the skies. They also know that to burn a warrior who lacked bravery, is to insult the gods. Such dead rise as vile pyrewights.

  

#### The Dead in the Dirt 
Raiders that die of natural causes, plague or the like, are buried in the earth. It is believed that the [[HEl, Lady of the Dead|Lady of the Dead]] claims those departed. Nightly she climbs atop a three-legged undead horse called a helhest, and rides the world, in search of these unworthy dead. Once found, she grasps the unfortunate corpse and rides hard into the earth, to the secret caverns deep within Grimnir that make up the Underworld. 

  

#### The Dead That Drown
Warfare at sea comes with an additional risk. The worst of all deaths, the raiders believe, is to fall into the sea. The living will try hard to recover the bodies of their fallen allies from the frigid waters of the Serpent Sea so that they may be honored properly. Otherwise, they become corpse food for the great serpent that lingers in the deepest waters of the sea and are denied an afterlife entirely. Instead, they return as smaller sea snakes that are known to foul fisher nets or drag children from the seashore.

####   

#### The Hidden World
Among all peoples of Grimnir there is a belief in a magical world that exists just out of sight. Fey creatures are thought to occupy this parallel world and some spellcasters insist they draw their power from it. In addition, creatures known as tomte are said to adopt farmers, protect them, and even assist them with chores on their farmsteads. Though seldom seen, their presence is often felt, and the family with a stalwart tomten, tends to thrive.



> _Put a horn of mead in me and I might tell you that partly I be hoping that when I carved out my eye like Aldyhn, I might be seeing more of the hidden world. But ‘fraid to admit it, I haven’t. Not a single tomten or valkry. But I still believe, it’s in our blood, the believing._
