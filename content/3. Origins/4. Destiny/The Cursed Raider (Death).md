Once you were an accomplished raider with a promising future, but you had also become arrogant and overly proud. You thought of yourself as a walking legend and your place in the Halls of Slain was surely guaranteed! Then you made the unfortunate mistake of allowing a rival clan’s foul-tongued skald to survive after a raiding victory. That skald cursed you upon that battlefield:

_"No death shall find you,  
As you walk all paths, across all lands,  
Beyond and below, all living things,  
Till the wolf rises at the forever sunset."_

You laughed off the curse, but that evening you choked on the bones of a boar while celebrating your victory and died an inglorious death. Your clan left you on that beach in the middle of nowhere, to be claimed by Hel and brought to her Underworld. They mourned for you, knowing that your death was unworthy, and you would never enter the Halls of the Slain.

Yet you returned to life the very next day. Since then, you have died several more times, but you always rise again, the following morning. Now you seek a way to end the curse so that you might die as a raider should and earn your place in the Halls of the Slain.

- **Player Interest:** Elric of Melniboné, Captain Navarre 
- **Restrictions:** Must be born in Grimnir

#### Source of Inspiration
You draw inspiration from the ending of lives, specifically lives of greater import whose ending is felt by others. You gain inspiration whenever you are directly responsible for ending the life of something meaningful, whether it’s that of a particularly powerful monster or a more abstract “life”, such as the practice of a time-honored tradition.  You also gain inspiration anytime you complete one of your Heroic Tasks.
*Kill or participate in killing a creature with CR equal to or higher than your class level, end an established organization, stop a long-standing tradition, break something ancient.*

#### Inspiration Feature
You are intricately familiar with the cycle of life and death and its many interruptions. As a bonus action, you can spend your inspiration to detect the location of either undead creatures or inanimate corpses within 60 feet of yourself. You learn the CR of any undead you detect in this way, as well as two of the following for a single undead (chosen after learning their location and CR): resistances , immunities, vulnerabilities, what languages it speaks, or its Armor Class. You learn the general cause of death for any corpse you detect with this ability (for example, you know a creature died of poison, but not what kind or how it was administered), its CR in life, and its creature type. You also gain advantage on all Medicine checks to examine a corpse you have detected in this way if you choose to exhume and study it.

#### Feature: A Raider’s Rune ( ᛁ )

You received a rune tattoo upon reaching adulthood in your clan, but upon your first death, it changed. That tattoo now resembles the rune ᛁ and indicates the frozen north, the unchanging lands, and you have long seen it as a sign that you must introduce change into your life. At certain moments in the story additional runes will be drawn, adding to your story, your abilities, and your penultimate reason for existing.

#### Feature: Curse of Undying

No matter how much damage is delivered you are never killed outright. Additionally, if you fail three death saving throws, you do not die. Instead, you appear dead, but at sunrise of the following day you are restored to 1 hit point, as if you had stabilized. However, when you awaken, you gain two levels each of fatigue and strife and lose 1 point of glory.

### Suggested Characteristics

You have lived many lifetimes, a wanderer among all the raiding clans and you may have even spent time with the Baendur. You have been many different people, but some core characteristics have remained with you, throughout.

### Starting Story Connection

After your expedition to Kekkell with Hrolf you intend to part ways and find a mysterious seer that is rumored to live in the town of Nowhere. You start with knowledge of the rough location of that town on your world map.

#### Heroic Tasks

- Find the Skald. You must locate the elf skald that cursed you and decipher how to break free from the curse to end your relentless life. 
- Seek the Components. You must seek out any materials or knowledge you need to prepare yourself for ending the curse. Doing so will provide you with a magical item that will help you end your curse. Reward. You find a powerful item. Choose one of the following:  
    - A powerful magical weapon of death (details to be revealed when it comes up in the campaign)
    - A bronze horn of Valhalla (usable only by you and without needing to meet the requirement for the item).
- End the Curse. With the knowledge received from the skald, you must do whatever it takes to sever the curse’s grip on your soul. Reward. You can now die as any other mortal might and when you do, you know you will enter the Halls of the Slain. You may also select a feat for which you meet the prerequisites.

#### Epic Goal: Enter the Halls of the Slain

You have lived many lives and long for your place beside the great hearth fires of the Halls of the Slain. You must die honorably in an epic battle that atones for both your prior arrogance as well as the numerous minor deaths you have incurred during your eternal life.

**Gift of Perseverance.** You have advantage on all saving throws.
