Aeromancers are wizards specialized in air magic. They often seem to move with a swiftness and lightness of foot that should not normally be possible. They are experts at riding currents of air, providing them with unmatched maneuverability, and have learned the art to listening to the wind, learning the secrets it carries unheard by most.

### Run Like the Wind
When you select this archetype at 2nd level beneficial winds aid in your movement as you weave your magic. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher you movement speed is increased by 10 feet and attacks of opportunity have disadvantage against you until the end of your next turn. This ability does not function while in a vacuum, underwater, or otherwise not surrounded by air.

### Listen to the Wind
Also at 2nd level you can use the wind to uncover secret information.  By spending 10 minutes concentrating outside, you may cast the *locate object* spell without expending a spell slot.<br>
At 6th level you may instead cast *locate creature* in this way.<br>
At 10th level you can cast *scrying* in this way.  Once you do so you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>
None of these spells function if the target is underwater, in a vacuum, in an airtight container, or otherwise does not have a path between you and it or them through the air, however small.

### Sweet Air
At 6th level your magic passively purifies the air around you and fills your lungs with sweet air. You can hold your breath for an additional number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus and have advantage on concentration checks to avoid losing your breath.  You also have advantage on saving throws against inhaled poisons and any spell or effect based on inhaling something harmful (such as *stinking cloud*, *cloudkill*, etc.), and have resistance to any damage they deal.

### Wrath of the Tempest
At 10th level, your mastery of air can empower the lightning and thunder damage you cast even against creatures normally resistant to them. Lightning or thunder damage from your spells treats immunity to lighting or thunder as though it were lightning or thunder resistance, and ignores lightning or thunder resistance entirely. Additionally, any spell you cast that deals lightning or thunder damage deals additional damage equal to your intelligence modifier on one damage roll.

### Soaring Heights
At 14th level whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed until the end of your next turn.<br>
Finally, your insight into air magic deepens. If you can find a written record of it, you can copy any air, lightning, or thunder spell into your spellbook as if it were a wizard spell. Once you do, it is a wizard spell for you.
