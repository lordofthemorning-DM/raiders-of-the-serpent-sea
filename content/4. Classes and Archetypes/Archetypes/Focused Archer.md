Focused archers are those adepts that have turned their focus, discipline, and training towards mastering a different weapon: the bow. They can perform amazing feats of long range pinpoint accuracy, and fire off arrows at lightning speed without any significant penalty. This is because for a focused archer, the bow is not merely a weapon or a tool, it is an extension of themselves, and it works fully in tandem with them.

### Take Aim
When you select this archetype at 3rd level you gain proficiency with longbows and shortbows and they count as adept weapons for you. You also gain proficiency with the Biting Zephyr combat tradition. You gain a bonus combat maneuver known from the Biting Zephyr tradition which does not count against your number of maneuvers known.

### Long Shot
At 6th level you can spend an exertion point to ignore long range penalties with your ranged weapon attacks until the start of your next turn..

### Ranged Flurry
At 11th level you can draw, knock, and loose arrows at incredible speed. You can make ranged weapon attacks as part of a flurry of blows in place of unarmed strikes as long as you made at least one ranged weapon attack during your attack action.

### Precision Shot
At 17th level you can use the Stunning Strike and Paralyzing Strike focus features with ranged weapon attacks.  If you do not already possess both of these focus features, you gain one of them, which does not count against your number of focus features known.  If you already possess both of them, you learn a different focus feature of your choice.
