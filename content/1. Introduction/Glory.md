## Glory

Glory is gathered by defeating powerful foes and taking plunder. The greater your glory, the more respect others, even your enemies, show you. Glory may be lost by not paying a debt or wrongly accusing another of a crime. 

Most individuals within raider society strive towards individual glory—gaining the respect, admiration, and, at times, the fear of others. They focus primarily on their individual accomplishments, even when it comes at a cost to their own companions. However, there is an ideal among the raiders, an example set during the Exodus at the world birthing. The Vanir. Those legendary heroes were bound together by oaths, deeds, and friendship. They shared their glory. If such a group of heroes ever rose again and fought the valiant fight, theirs might become a power that the world has not known for centuries.

The perks (and drawbacks) of great glory are summarized on the following table.

### Epithets

At a glory level of 4 or higher, epithets referring to the party as a group begin to be used by the people of the world. An example might be, “Heroes of the Long Winter” or “Heroes of the Fanged Sands.” The party can work together to pick a suitable epithet, or the game master may decide upon one. Be wary—making a major mistake may unduly influence the epithet the world remembers you for.

> _Glory, we seek, isn’t it so? We raiders, we take to the sea, we take our axe, our sword, in hand. We call it many things. But it is just the one thing, it is. It is so that they see us. They see what bravery we do in their name so that they know, when the world ends, that we are good enough to stand beside them. We do this for the Stone Court._

### Table of Raider Glory

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Glory Points|Perks and Drawbacks|Glory Points|Perks and Drawbacks|
|1|You are known by name at feasting halls near your first remarkable achievements.|11|The gods of the Stone Court have noticed you. A Divine Event occurs. And if you die you will be claimed by the valkry.|
|2|Any feasting hall associated with your clan will provide drink and food for free, as long as you tell a story. However, your deeds annoy non-raiders, and you have disadvantage on Intimidation or Persuasion attempts against the Baendur.|12|Your acclaim has spread to all raiding communities and though your rivals are jealous, they still recognize your deeds. You have advantage on any Persuasion or Intimidation check against other raiders.|
|3|You are challenged to a drinking contest at the next feasting hall you visit. Refusing (or losing) costs 1 glory point. The challenge may be issued by other raiders—even your own crew!|13|You have grown so popular that if you ever back down from a request for aid or a challenge by any friendly raider you immediately lose 3 points of glory.|
|4|Your crew has composed a variety of poetic songs about your exploits. When performed in front of you, they are always uplifting… those they sing behind your back tend to favor your missteps. Regardless, you are beginning to become known as the “Heroes of…” (See Epithets, opposite.)|14|Once per week, when you make an appearance in a raider village or enclave, roll once on the Consumables treasure table from the Raiders of the Serpent Sea GM Reference  to determine the gift the party receives.|
|5|You have become a local legend within the clan you are most often associated with. You have advantage on Persuasion checks against members of your clan|15|Young adults of your clan decide to use your given name as their family name—claiming you as their parent, at least in spirit|
|6|Your exploits are making you famous. For the price of a story, you have free food and drink in any raider feasting hall. You no longer have disadvantage on Intimidation and Persuasion against the Baendur|16|The famous historian, Otis, seeks you out, to create portraits of the party. Once this is accomplished you are forever known as the “Legends of…”|
|7|Your glory builds such that others seek you out to help them solve their own problems. You will receive a Mysterious Favor encounter.|17|A shrine has been constructed for you in a settlement of your choice (that you have previously visited). Each shrine is tended by a priest and visited often by skalds eager to learn your tale.|
|8|You receive gifts when visiting any settlement friendly to you. At such times you receive 2d20 silver pieces and a random item from the trinkets table.|18|With your expanding glory, so grows the number of raiders that idolize you. Two more shrines appear, in locations of your choice. Once a week, when you visit any shrine, you receive a charm of your choice.|
|9|Shipbuilders compete to design fearsome figureheads to adorn your longships. You are now able to purchase the rarest of these. Additionally, once per long rest you may attempt a boast with advantage to demand a debt be forgiven.|19|To the victors go the spoils and those that are victorious rewrite history. You may select one deed in the past and have history remember its outcome differently than what occurred. To accomplish this, you must wager 10 glory points and succeed in a DC 20 boast. (See Boasting, below.|
|10|Non raiders fear you. You now have advantage on Intimidation checks against the Baendur or other outsiders.|20|Your glory is such that you are as venerated as any of the Vanir ever were. With the proper rituals, you might even ascend to godhood, as they did.|
To make a Glory/Prestige check or to use it to call in a favor other than those detailed in this table, roll 1d20 and add 1/4 of your current glory score (minimum 1). If you are new to an area or otherwise would be unfamiliar to it, you roll with disadvantage. The DC remains calculated the same (12 plus twice the region level), but various prejudices, situations, etc., can impact that DC up to 4 in either direction.

Boasting

As an action you may wager your glory points to undertake a boast. Boasting is a Persuasion or Intimidation check, fueled by your popularity and the respect others give you. Select the number of glory points you wish to wager, and these will be applied as a bonus to the Persuasion or Intimidation. However…

- If you fail the check, you lose 1 glory point.
- If you roll a natural 1, you lose all the glory points you wagered.

  
Fellowship

Glory is held by the individual and should be tracked by each player. However, if the oath of fellowship has been sworn, each heroes’ glory is now connected to the others. Any time a member of the fellowship loses glory, all other members lose one glory point immediately. However, the fellowship also protects the boaster—when they lose a boast, their glory cannot be reduced below the lowest glory level of the other members (after the previously mentioned deduction). This makes wagering glory during a boast less risky.
