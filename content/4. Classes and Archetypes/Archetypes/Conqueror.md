Conquerors are fearsome heralds dedicating to conquering and subjugating others.  Some truly believe they have the right to rule, and that may even be true, while others simply seek to accumulate personal power and wealth.  Most have something of a rightfully dark reputation, but there are more noble expressions, such as those who fight fire with fire seeking to take back lands conquered by others that rightly belong to them or their people, or those desperate to unite shortsighted factions against a greater evil.

Regardless of the cause that drives them forward all conquerors hold similar tenets.

- **No Quarter.**  Surrender may be accepted if you dictate total and absolute terms, but for those that resist there is no mercy.
- **Crush Hope.**  So long as the enemy believes they can fight they will resist.  Correct them of their mistake.
- **Ever Advance.**  It is not enough simply to defend what you have.  Whether by ancestral right, divine right, or the right of might you seek to press on and expand your holdings, be they land, possessions, or prestige.
- **Iron Will, Iron Body.**  You must show total conviction in your choices, no matter what doubts you bury within, and maintain the personal strength of arms to back them up.  An army is only as strong as its head.
